                   Before using your hard drive, you typically need to allocate space and assign each allocated space to a
                   particular purpose in order for your OS to gain access to it. By default, there are usually partitions
                   for recovery purposes or anything that has to do with system embedded software. If you are nit picky
                   about organizing your hard drive like myself, it may be in your favor to partition your hard drive(s) in
                   a way that you find organized by allocating specific areas for whatever general data you want that area for. 
                   Also, it is favorable to make sure you are actually using all the space
                   you need that is installed in your system. If you want to make a multiboot system, partitioning will also
                   need to be done to allocate space for specific operating systems. OS installers normally prompt users to
                   a hard drive partitioning menu. In windows, you can use the "Computer Management" app or type in 
                   "diskmgmt.msc" in the DOS prompt to access the app. You might need to run it as administrator since you
                   are modifying system hardware. The app looks like the following:<br/><br/>
                   <img src=Partition.PNG width="100%" height="100%"/><br/><br/>
                   To partition, you simply right click on any unallocated area and allocate some if not all the space left.
                   However, it is preferable to do this prior to installing an operating system in order to prevent space
                   gaps once a system is already installed. Also, partitioning on already allocated areas <b>WILL</b> format that
                   area in your hardrive so be careful and <b>BACK UP</b> all your data before attempting to do any repartitioning.
                   Anything with unallocated space is however safe to touch.

                   We have all gone through the insatiably repetitive task of updating and proof reading our resumes
                   in order to maximize the quality of how we sell ourselves to the industry. Before I go into the few 
                   tips I'd like to share about writing resumes, I would like to mention a few principles to consider
                   regarding resumes. First off, your resume is your marketing tool therefore, it is vital that it
                   goes through substantial edits and feedback from multiple eyes. Everyone has different ideas for
                   what makes a resume good but the ideas that matter are those who have the recruiting power. Thus, the more people
                   you can get to review your resume, the more information you have on marketing yourself optimally
                   to the perspective of others. Another point to mention is that a recruiter will spend an average
                   of 5-10 seconds looking at your resume so plan accordingly to best communicate your experience
                   and format in a quick read friendly way. Now to discuss some tips on writing your resume:
                   <br/><br/>
                   - adopt a mindset that you can never write the perfect resume and be prepared to take constructive
                   criticism; the more flexible you are, the better ability you have in writing a good resume<br/>
                   - NO MORE than one page; if it's over a page, it's a CV so make it work<br/>
                   - avoid having a high concentrated area of text in order to make your resume more desirable to read
                   within a few seconds<br/>
                   - it helps to bold keywords<br/>
                   - numerical metrics look good (ie. "design saved 45 watts of power"; "cut costs by 14%"")<br/>
                   - conserve space; you only have a page (only put job relevant information that can actually help your chances of getting hired)<br/>
                   - objectives/ summaries are a waste of space; whatever job you apply for, the recruiter already knows your objective which
                   is obviously to land that job so just get to the point with your skills and experience<br/>
                   - school projects are frowned upon but if you have no other experience, strive to explain your project in a way that
                   APPLIES relevant skills (ie. "implemented autocomplete algorithm for user generated text" rather than "programmed multiway trie")<br/>
                   - go out of your way to do projects; there's plenty of tutorials online that can apply and sharpen your skills<br/>
                   - use "achiever" rather than "doer" statements for your descriptions (ie. "proposed agreement with payroll contractors 
                   slashing labor costs by 10%" rather than "negotiated with payroll contractors")<br/>
                   - send text versions of your resume; there's a good chance that the selection process is computerized and based on
                   keyterms present in resumes; see how your resume looks using <a href="https://pdftotext.com/" target="_blank">ATS</a> (Applicant Tracking System)<br/>
                   - hyperlinks look good for showing proof of your projects but keep the format (don't use hyperlink default format)<br/>
                   - anything you write on your resume is fair game for interview questions so STUDY; the point of your resume is to land 
                   the interview, once that is accomplished, the next step is making sure you are prepared to talk about everything in your resume<br/>
                   - keep resume up-to-date; in the unfortunate event you are unemployed for an extended period, do projects and put them in your resume<br/>
                   - unless your relevant experience was temporary work, it's a rule of thumb to add relavant employment only if it lasted for at least a year<br/>
                   - use generic words when labeling sections to make it easy for ATS to read resume (you should have terms such as skills, experience, employment, certifications etc.)<br/>
                   - avoid naming your sections with obscure terms (ie. skills instead of competencies, work/ employment over professional)<br/>
