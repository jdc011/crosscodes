                   Looking for a job? Trying to get your career started? Looking to expand your network, learn about new opportunities, or
                   to get to know more companies that are looking for you? Attending a career fair is a great way to address any of the above
                   desires. To get the most out of your career fair experience, here are 9 tips that have been explained by those who run
                   the quarterly Triton Career Fair at UCSD:<br/><br/>
                   <b>1. Have healthy expectations</b><br/>
                   Don't expect that you will be successful with whatever top tech company is your top
                   choice. Also understand that the more competitive companies will have longer lines that can have you waiting for over an
                   hour. You should ask yourself if it's worth it to invest all that time waiting in line for one company rather than
                   exploring around. In general, don't put all your eggs in one basket. You want to expand your options. The point of
                   attending a career fair is to expand your employment opportunities in addition to meeting with employers face to face
                   and expanding your network. Also, understand that attending career fairs does not necessarily give you a higher probability
                   of landing a job over mass applying online. The advantage is mainly networking and educating yourself about open
                   opportunities.<br/><br/>
                   <b>2. Bring several copies of your updated resume</b><br/>
                   It is better to have too much than too little copies of your physical resume. The last thing you want is to run out of copies
                   with the presence of potential employers you have yet to talk to. I normally bring at least 20 copies.<br/><br/>
                   <b>3. Do your research on the companies attending</b><br/>
                   Want to know about companies you are aiming to work for? Do your research on the given list of companies attending. 
                   This also lets employers know that you are
                   interested in them by taking the time to learn about their companies as well as give you something to talk about. When
                   researching, it is best to start at their website. Look for the essentials; their mission statement, what they do, and who they
                   serve. Read up on some articles to expand your research and/ or find a Wiki page or blog about them to expand your knowledge.
                   Try to find out their technical background and process if you can as well as any soft skills and principles they value. After 
                   you learned a thing or two, figure out how you can positively impact their company with the skill set you have to offer by
                   looking for ties in your resume and their expectations. It also helps to apply online beforehand.<br/><br/>
                   <b>4. Rank employers you want to meet</b><br/>
                   It is good practice to keep a spreadsheet ranking the companies you want to meet. Do your research and prioritize what you are
                   personally looking for. This can include culture, type of work, company perks, benefits, salary, location, etc. Ask yourself
                   where you would want to work and why. Obviously don't actually talk about benefits. You are not yet in the position to be
                   negotiating your compensation when talking to the employers. Also be sure to factor in the expected amount of time you will
                   be in line for a company.<br/><br/>
                   <b>5. Practice your elevator pitch</b><br/>
                   Usually, employers will ask you to tell them a little about yourself. Being confident shows good character and helps the
                   employers remember you later. This confidence comes with practice. Come up with an outline of your technical background,
                   what you are looking for, and how you can contribute, and rehearse it. Learn to communicate it effectively and confidently
                   but be humble. Practice your flow. It doesn't take that much time to practice a 30-45 second elevator pitch.<br/><br/>
                   <b>6. Manage your time wisely</b><br/>
                   Make sure you can meet as much of your higher prioritized companies. Show up as early as possible to get as much time as
                   you need. Some lines take over an hour of waiting. Ask yourself whether it's worth it to wait that long. A long wait can be
                   time wasted that could've been spent talking to other companies. Also, don't spend too much time talking to one company. Be
                   brief in explaining your highlights. Remember that employers are trying to give everyone an equal chance to talk to them. Also,
                   taking too long with a employer can have negative consequences. They may not appreciate you taking a significant chunk of their
                   time in addition to wasting your own time.<br/><br/>
                   <b>7. Dress for success</b><br/>
                   The dress doesn't make the person but if you can, do it. I gives the employer a sense of respectability of your character
                   knowing that you took the time to dress well to talk to them.<br/><br/>
                   <b>8. Ask for contact information and follow up along with a "thank you"</b><br/>
                   Increase your chances of getting an interview and the employers remembering you by asking for business cards and contact information
                   with intention to follow up a week later. Be sure to mention anything significant from the past conversation that can help you land 
                   an interview. Also, thank them for their time. It shows that you are respectable.<br/><br/>
                   <b>9. Be prepared</b><br/>
                   Have a folder handy to hold your resumes, a pen to write with (having a pen ready makes a good impression), and some paper to take
                   important notes. Having a tablet at hand is a plus if you can use it to show the employers relevant work, perhaps your online portfolio
                   if you have one.<br/><br/>
                   Overall, be courteous, be professional, be prepared, and be humble. Make sure you are there for the right reasons.

                   This blog post is an extension of <a href="blog_2.html#13">Resume tips</a> if you have not read up on that post yet. I attended
                   a career fair prep event where I got my resume critiqued thanks to <a href="https://act.ucsd.edu/directory/search?search-scope=directory&entry=melissa+hoon&site=career" target="_blank">
                   Melissa Hoon</a>, a UCSD Career Center staff member. In addition to my previous post on Resumes, here are some more tips from her:<br/><br/>
                   - include objective with buzz words (specific type of job you're looking for + location; be brief (1 - 2 phrases), enthusiastic, and state the skills you have to offer)<br/>
                   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This contradicts my previous post.<br/> 
                   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Objectives make it clear what job<br/> 
                   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you're looking for and serve as a<br/>
                   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; small elevator pitch to sell yourself.<br/>
                   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, there's no need to go<br/>
                   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; overboard. Conserve space for the rest<br/>
                   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of your content.<br/>
                   - make room for the content that sells you (expand margins; limit spaces and font sizes; use columns, footers, headers; etc. make it work on one page)<br/>
                   - communicate effectively (make your content state the impact you made rather than it being task based)<br/>
                   - descriptions typically start with verbs (actions) and are structured as (action making impact -> using these technical and or soft skills)<br/>
                   - include buzz words for soft skills; important to compliment your tech skills (leadership, communication, collaboration, etc.)<br/>
                   - include <b>HOW</b> the skills in your skill set section developed with projects<br/>
                   - data/ metrics are a plus; try to include concrete numerical data where applicable<br/>
                   - include relevant project subsection in employment section if directly relevant<br/>
                   - any outside work, label as "relevant experience"<br/>
                   - .pdf is an ideal format when including your resume to a job application (use <a href="https://pdftotext.com/" target="_blank">ATS</a> to see if it parses all your resume's text)<br/>
                   - format hyperlinks to make it obvious they are links<br/>
                   - organize sections of your resume in a way that is easy to differentiate each of them<br/>
                   - be consistent in how you label/ indent sections and subsections of your resume based on its structure<br/>
                   - prioritize top to bottom the following order (objective -> skills -> education -> work -> relevant experience etc.)<br/><br/>

                   Here is the before and after of my current resume given my previous tips, and Melissa's tips respectively:<br/><br/>
                   <b>Before:</b><br/>
                   <object width="100%" height="1050px" data="IResume.pdf"></object><br/><br/>
                   <b>After:</b><br/>
                   <object width="100%" height="1050px" data="MyResume.pdf"></object><br/><br/>

                   <b>Changes</b><br/>
                   The most obvious one is that I found a way to move my skill set to the top with the use of columns. Also, listing them vertically
                   makes it easier for a recruiter to see what all my skills are versus listing them horizontally. For the margins, they are now 
                   expanded. Hyperlinks are now noticeable. For the content, I moved some of my projects to the experience section since they are
                   directly related to the organization. "Projects" is now labeled with "Relevant" to emphasize the urgency for a recruiter consider them. I also focused on adding more metrics
                   and communicating the impacts I made rather than the task I did in addition to my skill applications. The added content made
                   me have to limit spaces and font sizes. The expanded margins also helped make space. Lastly, I added a brief objective stating
                   the line of work I am looking for with what I have to offer.

                	the creation of <a href="http://crosscodes.biz" target="_blank">Crosscodes</a> in my case; to showcase my professional work and experience while job hunting, and to document what I have learned in my career on this blog. This experience typically begins in university where students are adamant in obtaining a quantity of technical skills from their classes whilst performing at the highest caliber possible. A software engineer with an ideal attitude is described as "one who is always hungry to learn". The goal is to be professionally competitive in terms of experience in order to gain access to higher standing careers. Through academics, this can be achieved through GPA, awards, recognition, projects, letters of recommendation, degrees, and technical knowledge. Outside of academics, one can also seek more experience through engineering organizations, outside projects, hackathons, internships, and relevant employment. The presence of this experience follows with the steps to land an engineering title under a respectable company and acquire even more technical skills. A good place to start in one's job hunting journey are career fairs where multiple companies are arranged in panels where participants can showcase their resumes and electronic portfolios or relevant work. Hackathons also typically have company panels where showcasing one's resume is also appropriate in addition to submitting a winning hack. Companies present at hackathons typically assess participants' performance based on their hack. This makes hackathons a perfect place to showcase one's technical ability since companies use these events to look for potential candidates. While software engineers taking part in this networking culture are selling their competencies, companies are looking for engineers to invest in since they can provide valuable assets. Thus, companies are also competing to hire and compensate engineers to the best of their ability. I have also seen job fairs and professional networking events happening within engineering organizations. One's resume is their best friend when marketing their skills. It is also appropriate in casual settings to showcase one's resume therefore, always having one at hand is good practice. There have been multiple times where I have been asked for my resume in casual settings when I gave off hints of being a software engineer in search of a job; to where I reply by presenting the link to this website. These casual settings can happen anywhere including company social gatherings where the purpose is for engineers to get to know each other in terms of who posses what skill set, and bond to form a team. One looking to move up the ranks within their company can take advantage of this setting by chatting with higher experienced individuals. Individuals who have taken an extra step in this networking culture have created websites to not only showcase their experience, but present it in a personal way thereby proving technical competencies in web development in particular but more importantly, validating presentation skills and showing a uniqueness in personality. Having a <a href="http://linkedin.com" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> and/ or <a href="http://github.com" target="_blank">GitHub</a> account are also great ways for one to present their experience and have an online persona. This contributes
                	to a world wide web of software engineers available to connect and compete for networking power in order to gain the upper advantage.
                	I have also noticed individuals blogging or publishing specific work or articles while connecting with other software engineers either for mentoring, or
                	to expand their networking power. Keep in mind that soft skills should not be ignored. In fact, a common mistake for some individuals is spending too much time harnasing
                	their technical skills while neglecting their soft skills. To stand out even further, one will want to have good communication skills and be presentable. This involves
                	but is not limited to being able to communicate effectively in a panel, showcasing slide shows, being organized, punctual, and being a leader and a team player. Although this
                	blog post was focused on the technical aspect of the networking culture, that is only one out of many aspects to consider when being professionally competitive.

                  This was my very first hackathon experience and quite an eventful one, much more than
                  what I expected. To start off, my impression of these events lies on one far end of
                  the spectrum of whether one can appreciate this event as being a rather eventful
                  challenge for highly aspiring engineers or feeling just about the opposite way
                  strongly. For me, I saw it as a challenge in terms of time and expected innovation,
                  and opportunity on the count of the networking chances and a vast array of hacks.
                  I definitely took advantage of the networking opportunities gaining insight from
                  multiple companies and exchanging ideas as well as offering my resume and professional 
                  online persona. I also took advantage of an API from Twilio in the hack that my team
                  came up with. From the networking opportunities to the handed challenge of coming up
                  with a hack that can become innovative, I also saw this experience as a convention for
                  many engineers to collaborate and exchange ideas from within a medium that everyone
                  can gain more knowledge from each other. Of course, the crown jewel of this event was
                  cranking out 2 all-nighters coming up with an innovative idea given ideas, hardware,
                  and even open source code provided by companies. I surely gained an idea, technical
                  skills, and stamina from this event. Best of all, my team won the grand prize for our
                  implementation of an IoT smart fridge.<br/>

                  The study of computer science is defined by the scientific approach to answer
                  the problems of computation, the way that computers solve problems. Normally,
                  one would expect this degree to lead them to a software engineering career however,
                  the main take away I would like to point out is that software engineering is only
                  one out of many specific branches of computer science, one which is highly marketable 
                  in the industry. While one's expectation in a nutshell is that a CS degree leads to a
                  six-figure career, one must understand that this is not the case GENERALLY speaking
                  of the field of computer science. I will discuss from my experience what this field
                  of study actually is in a general sense rather than it being associated to a high
                  paying job. As I have noted earlier, computer science is a scientific mean of
                  computation. That is to say, the scientific method is actually used to solve the
                  problem of how to compute. Formerly, I misconstrued why this was considered science
                  but back then, my only experience at the time was coding, only one out of many aspects 
                  of computer science. When taking part in this field of study, one should expect three
                  main branches of computation. That is software, hardware, and theory. The most obvious
                  branch is software, anything that has to do with code and abstraction. This where I
                  felt I missed the understanding of this field being a science. Coding is more of an
                  application or toolbox to actively address a problem of computation. How does the code
                  actually work in a physical level? That brings me to the branch of hardware, particularly
                  digital design. This focuses on how to physically create the CPU to be programmed to solve
                  computable problems. This branch focuses on how to use signals on and off for a computer
                  to physically execute what the code tells it to do. How has all of this been figured out
                  to this day? This brings me to the theoretical branch of computer science. Every idea is
                  a theory until proven and put into practice. The theory branch is where most of the science
                  exists. It attempts to answer computation questions; what is solvable, how to solve it, and
                  how efficient it can be. A lot of algorithms and their efficiencies is studied in this
                  branch as well as a lot of hypothesis being tested. The theory of computation addresses
                  computing models to attempt to solve problems before the machine is built (hardware)
                  and code is given to it to put the solution into practice (software). All together, we
                  have the field of computer science.

               I have always had this burning question before I got into the industry. With CS being
               a rather abstract field of study, what does one actually do in the work force with all
               the abstract concepts in mind? First of all, I would like to make very clear that
               EVERYTHING one does in their course work is vital to their career. While some aspect
               in college may be directly or indirectly beneficial, every task is tied to each other
               and builds on itself. Any curriculum is built in its own unique way to educate aspiring
               engineers through time, addressing specific goals. To answer the question of what happens
               in the industry, expect projects as far as the eye can see to come under way, as well as
               the expectation of teamwork to accomplish large scale projects. Whether it is a basic
               application, some back-end database, or complicated network system, a CS degree's worth
               of skills to be used as one's toolbox is more than enough to answer an endless array
               of problems. To put it simply, college curriculums aim to allow engineers to grow
               overtime with the expectation that all information will be tied together in the end
               and can be recalled and utilized in some fashion to answer the consumer's need.
               College is all building, and practicing, with due dates simulating a consumer's 
               actual time of need for a product, and one's grade simulating how the consumer reacts 
               to one's work. Also, studying is acquiring  one's unique engineering toolbox while
               working is applying that toolbox to address a consumer's problem. However, what is
               physically done in school, one can expect it to be done in the industry as well.
