                  This was my very first hackathon experience and quite an eventful one, much more than
                  what I expected. To start off, my impression of these events lies on one far end of
                  the spectrum of whether one can appreciate this event as being a rather eventful
                  challenge for highly aspiring engineers or feeling just about the opposite way
                  strongly. For me, I saw it as a challenge in terms of time and expected innovation,
                  and opportunity on the count of the networking chances and a vast array of hacks.
                  I definitely took advantage of the networking opportunities gaining insight from
                  multiple companies and exchanging ideas as well as offering my resume and professional 
                  online persona. I also took advantage of an API from Twilio in the hack that my team
                  came up with. From the networking opportunities to the handed challenge of coming up
                  with a hack that can become innovative, I also saw this experience as a convention for
                  many engineers to collaborate and exchange ideas from within a medium that everyone
                  can gain more knowledge from each other. Of course, the crown jewel of this event was
                  cranking out 2 all-nighters coming up with an innovative idea given ideas, hardware,
                  and even open source code provided by companies. I surely gained an idea, technical
                  skills, and stamina from this event. Best of all, my team won the grand prize for our
                  implementation of an IoT smart fridge.<br/>

                  The study of computer science is defined by the scientific approach to answer
                  the problems of computation, the way that computers solve problems. Normally,
                  one would expect this degree to lead them to a software engineering career however,
                  the main take away I would like to point out is that software engineering is only
                  one out of many specific branches of computer science, one which is highly marketable 
                  in the industry. While one's expectation in a nutshell is that a CS degree leads to a
                  six-figure career, one must understand that this is not the case GENERALLY speaking
                  of the field of computer science. I will discuss from my experience what this field
                  of study actually is in a general sense rather than it being associated to a high
                  paying job. As I have noted earlier, computer science is a scientific mean of
                  computation. That is to say, the scientific method is actually used to solve the
                  problem of how to compute. Formerly, I misconstrued why this was considered science
                  but back then, my only experience at the time was coding, only one out of many aspects 
                  of computer science. When taking part in this field of study, one should expect three
                  main branches of computation. That is software, hardware, and theory. The most obvious
                  branch is software, anything that has to do with code and abstraction. This where I
                  felt I missed the understanding of this field being a science. Coding is more of an
                  application or toolbox to actively address a problem of computation. How does the code
                  actually work in a physical level? That brings me to the branch of hardware, particularly
                  digital design. This focuses on how to physically create the CPU to be programmed to solve
                  computable problems. This branch focuses on how to use signals on and off for a computer
                  to physically execute what the code tells it to do. How has all of this been figured out
                  to this day? This brings me to the theoretical branch of computer science. Every idea is
                  a theory until proven and put into practice. The theory branch is where most of the science
                  exists. It attempts to answer computation questions; what is solvable, how to solve it, and
                  how efficient it can be. A lot of algorithms and their efficiencies is studied in this
                  branch as well as a lot of hypothesis being tested. The theory of computation addresses
                  computing models to attempt to solve problems before the machine is built (hardware)
                  and code is given to it to put the solution into practice (software). All together, we
                  have the field of computer science.

               I have always had this burning question before I got into the industry. With CS being
               a rather abstract field of study, what does one actually do in the work force with all
               the abstract concepts in mind? First of all, I would like to make very clear that
               EVERYTHING one does in their course work is vital to their career. While some aspect
               in college may be directly or indirectly beneficial, every task is tied to each other
               and builds on itself. Any curriculum is built in its own unique way to educate aspiring
               engineers through time, addressing specific goals. To answer the question of what happens
               in the industry, expect projects as far as the eye can see to come under way, as well as
               the expectation of teamwork to accomplish large scale projects. Whether it is a basic
               application, some back-end database, or complicated network system, a CS degree's worth
               of skills to be used as one's toolbox is more than enough to answer an endless array
               of problems. To put it simply, college curriculums aim to allow engineers to grow
               overtime with the expectation that all information will be tied together in the end
               and can be recalled and utilized in some fashion to answer the consumer's need.
               College is all building, and practicing, with due dates simulating a consumer's 
               actual time of need for a product, and one's grade simulating how the consumer reacts 
               to one's work. Also, studying is acquiring  one's unique engineering toolbox while
               working is applying that toolbox to address a consumer's problem. However, what is
               physically done in school, one can expect it to be done in the industry as well.
