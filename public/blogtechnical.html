					I am currently using Linux mint which is based off of Ubuntu. After about three years of owning my
					Alienware 17 R2, I noticed my laptop would randomly power off at times getting more consistent over a
					couple weeks of use. It eventually got to the point where my laptop became unusable. I thought it was
					a software issue at first until I noticed the same problem after booting from a flash drive. From here,
					I diagnosed the temperature, battery, RAM, and GPU in that order. Temperature was normal. The 
					laptop would still power off when plugged in so the battery was not the issue. Normally I would not even
					be able to boot into the OS if RAM was an issue so I skipped this. This left me with the GPU which turned
					out to be the problem. Also, another hint was that this was happening significantly more often in Linux 
					than Windows (The reason for this will be discussed later). At the meantime, I believed there was something
					wrong with the NVIDIA GTX GPU that came with the laptop unfortunately soldered onto the mobo making 
					replacement inefficient. To verify this, I ran extensive graphics tests involving playing HD videos for
					hours with only Intel HD graphics enabled. Interestingly, the laptop managed to stay on for days unless the
					battery died. When I switched back to NVIDIA, the laptop powered off right away leading to my confirmation
					of this being a graphics related issue. For my solution, I simply opened Device Manager on Windows and
					disabled NVIDIA. For Linux, I made sure NVIDIA was running through Driver Manager which originally wasn't
					making me unable to configure the card. Nonetheless, it was still enabled acting as a possible culprit 
					for the crash. I installed Nvidia Prime to be able to select which graphics card to run. The commands work
					as follows:<br/><br/>
					<div class="codebox">
					<font style="font-family:'Courier New'" color="lime">sudo prime-select intel</font> <font color=blue># enable Intel GPU</font><br/>
					<font style="font-family:'Courier New'" color="lime">sudo prime-select nvidia</font> <font color=blue># enable NVIDIA GPU</font><br/>
					<font style="font-family:'Courier New'" color="lime">sudo prime-select query</font> <font color=blue># verify which GPU is enabled</font>
					</div><br/><br/>
					I noticed that on the task bar in Linux, I can see the icon of the GPU that is currently running which
					requires logging out and back in for changes to be applied. I also noticed that running NVIDIA would
					cause Linux Mint to run in fallback mode. In conclusion, I thought simply disabling NVIDIA fixed the 
					problem which appeared to be the case. It turns out that it was a software problem all along, 
					specifically with the Nouveau driver that Linux uses with NVIDIA. After doing some research, I stumbled
					upon the command <font style="font-family:'Courier New'">inxi -G</font> used to output system hardware status with the 'G' flag to specify graphics. I
					was presented with the following output:<br/><br/>
					<div class="codebox"><font style="font-family:'Courier New'" color="lime"><font color="lightblue"><b>Graphics:  Card-1:</font></b> Intel 4th Gen Core Processor Integrated Graphics Controller<br/>
           			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><font color="lightblue">Card-2:</font></b> NVIDIA GM204M [GeForce GTX 970M] <font color="red"><b>FAILED:</b></font> nouveau<br/>

           			</font></div><br/><br/>
           			Notice the "FAILED: nouveau" line. I believed this changed how I should approach this problem. I ran NVIDIA
           			once more but this time ran the proprietary driver for NVIDIA in Driver Manager rather than Nouveau. I ran
           			my graphics tests again with NVIDIA enabled and Nouveau disabled. Miraculously, my laptop stayed on for days
           			running these tests. I tried the same for Windows after enabling this configuration on Linux and got the same
           			results. When I ran the "inxi" command on Linux, the failure was gone. I mentioned the issue to a friend who is more 
           			experienced in hardware and he happened to know about Nouveau and was adamant in assuring me that it's a
           			terrible driver. Looks like the problem was solved. Lesson, <b>DO NOT</b> use Nouveau. Use Nvidia Prime.<br/><br/>
           			In case you have this problem, here are the steps to rectify it:<br/>
           			1. Install Nvidia Prime via <font style="font-family:'Courier New'">sudo apt install nvidia-prime</font>.<br/>
           			2. Open Driver manager. You can also use the command <font style="font-family:'Courier New'">driver-manager</font>.<br/>
           			3. Make sure to enable the proprietary driver for NVIDIA and not Nouveau.<br/>
           			4. Type <font style="font-family:'Courier New'">inxi -G</font> to verify that Nouveau is no longer failing or
           			even enabled.

                      I can personally say that dual booting pretty much saved my life as a computer
		      science student at UCSD having UNIX forced down my throat; not that it's a bad
		      thing. As a programmer, you will need to know how to use the UNIX command line.
		      Typically, students rely on ssh to access their Linux accounts. This has proven
		      to be unreliable to me in a handful of times where connectivity was bad or the
		      server had too many students logged on, normally during an assignment deadline.
		      Also, since you need to know UNIX, why not have a copy of Linux handy on your
		      machine? Today, I present a tutorial on how to dual boot your Windows computer.<br/>

		      <br/>

		      <center>
		      <b>What you will need:</b><br/>
		      Flash drive with enough space<br/>
		      <a href="https://www.pendrivelinux.com/universal-usb-installer-easy-as-1-2-3/" target="_blank">Universal USB installer</a><br/>
		      <b>One</b> of the following ISO files:<br/>
		      <a href="https://www.ubuntu.com/download" target="_blank">Ubuntu ISO file</a><br/>
		      <a href="https://lubuntu.net/downloads/" target="_blank">Lubuntu ISO file</a><br/>
		      <a href="https://xubuntu.org/download/" target="_blank">Xubuntu ISO file</a><br/>
		      <a href="https://kubuntu.org/getkubuntu/" target="_blank">Kubuntu ISO file</a><br/>
		      <a href="https://linuxmint.com/download.php" target="_blank">Mint ISO file</a><br/>
		      **You can use whatever ISO file you want, these are just the one's that I know
		      work for this tutorial.**<br/>
		      Your Windows computer (if you don't already have it)<br/>
		      <br/>
		      </center>

		      If you already have Windows installed, then you're already half way there. If not,
		      you will need to obtain an ISO file for Windows. Simply plug in your flash drive
		      to a computer and drag the Windows ISO file to it. Again, make sure you actually
		      have enough space to do this. Different OS's have different space requirements.
		      Go head and run Universal USB installer once you've downloaded it. It's very straight
		      forward. Select your flash drive by letter, your ISO file, and the appropriate OS
		      from the list. Be sure to have the format hard drive option unchecked unless you want
		      to delete everything from it prior to your installation. This process takes about 2-5
		      minutes. When it's finished, you will notice that your flash drive label has been changed
		      to UUI. When you open it, you will notice all the boot files. It is important you do
		      not modify the locations of any files otherwise, it will not work. Your boot loader
		      looks for the files in your flash drive's root directory. Reboot your computer with
		      the flash drive plugged in. Check your BIOS to see whether you have the boot priority set
		      to find your flash drive. You should then see the setup manager for the Windows installation.
		      Follow directions and be sure to install Windows in an available partition in your hard
		      drive. All you have to do is go through the wizard. When finished, you should have Windows 
		      installed on your computer and should be able to boot into it once you remove your flash
		      drive and reboot your machine. Notice, whenever you need to reformat your Windows partition,
		      you basically have a rescue disk in your flash drive assuming you have backed up all your
		      personal data. I recommend creating a folder in your flash drive and storing all the boot
		      files in there. Whenever you need to install Windows again, simply copy all the files
		      back to the root directory. You will do the same exact procedure to install Linux. If all
		      goes well, you should see the Grub instead of Windows boot manager with a list of all your
		      OS's every time you boot your machine. Typically, Windows must be installed first for this
		      to work. You now have a dual booting machine with Linux natively installed. You also have
		      rescue disks for both of your OS's.<br>

		      <br/>

		      <b>Steps summary:</b><br/>
		      Step 1: Acquire the materials listed above.<br/>
		      Step 2: Install the ISO file to the flash drive with UUI.<br/>
		      Step 3: Reboot your machine with your flash drive plugged in. Check your BIOS if you need to
		      configure your boot priorities.<br/>
		      Step 4: Go through the installation wizard.
