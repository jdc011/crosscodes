                  During the 2018 Winter Triton Career fair, I had the opportunity to show 5 companies my
                  blog and get their approval on posting their responses to about their hiring process. I
                  hope the following information serves any help to any aspiring engineers. Good luck with
                  your job searches!<br/>
                  <br/>

                  <b>Question:</b> When looking for candidate employees to hire post interview, what do you
                  look for?<br/>

                  <br/>

                  <b>App Folio:</b> The primary thing I personally look for is the background technical
                  knowledge the applicant has in his/ her arsenal. This is the primary but not everything.
                  In other words, if this is lacking, it's most likely a rejection. The knowledge I'm 
                  talking about are CS fundamentals such as data structures and algorithms. The next thing
                  I look for are any projects they have done outside of school. This shows me that the
                  applicant is interested in what he/ she is doing and willing to take it outside the scope
                  of their schooling. School related major projects are good but outside of school is a 
                  plus. I'm not necessarily looking for any particular set of skills. Our framework is
                  written on Ruby on Rails and me myself never used this before I started working for App
                  Folio. However, one's background knowledge and experience outside of school shows me
                  their learning potential that they can contribute to the company. Lastly, I look for
                  individuals who are excellent problem solvers and more importantly, those who can
                  communicate effectively; get their point across accurately and clearly.<br/>

                  <br/>

                  <b>Stemonix:</b> As for technical skills, I look for one's ability to learn new technology
                  and specifically how well they can design. When it comes to education, those with a higher
                  level background are always preferred. But more importantly, I look for what they can
                  design and how good they are at what they do relative to their level education. I look for
                  critical thinkers, those who are efficient, and those who can learn fast given what their
                  technical background has to offer them. Even though higher levels of education are preferred,
                  I really care more about how they can harness what they have to offer. However, the more
                  important side is their attitude. I look up to individuals who have the character of a good
                  employee. This involves their punctuality, organization, work ethic, presentability, and
                  how well they can communicate. The technical side is moreover a tool to get the job done
                  but what really makes a good employee is HOW they work regardless of what technical
                  knowledge they have to offer.<br/>

                  <br/>

                  <b>Synopsys:</b> In university, technical background is extremely emphasized and if one can
                  get through the educational rigor their university has to offer without cheating, those are
                  means to an end. A weakness in this mindset is the lack of emphasis in one's soft skills. If
                  I can find a candidate who has excellent soft skills, they will stand out in the talent 
                  pool given the addition of the necessary background knowledge to perform their jobs. What I
                  look for is a candidate's ability to communicate effectively and firmly, work well with a
                  team, talk to strangers, offer good customer service, and present well. The technical skills
                  are only a means to an end however, it's the soft skills that will land one a job especially
                  in Silicon Valley. A good candidate would be memorable. This is one who can effectively argue
                  their points and still get along with a team, have good social skills, and be able to present
                  or lecture confidently with the ability to design good power points to back up those presentations.
                  Overall, it is the character that determines who will land the position. The technical background
                  is just a filter for those who have potential.<br/>

                  <br/>

                  <b>Aetna:</b> You need to be an excellent communicator. I cannot stress this enough. We get a lot
                  of applicants who have a lot of technical skills to show off but not enough people skills. When
                  it comes to technical skills, showing that one can use their technical background is a way for
                  one to sell themselves in their interview. However, I didn't know what I know now in terms of
                  technical skills before working at Aetna. The act of selling one's self, their ability to SHOW 
                  that they can perform the job given their technical background, that's a people skill. I like to 
                  see those who are aggressive yet approachable in addition to having the rudimentary technical
                  qualifications. While the technical qualifications are also a factor, the determining factor is one's
                  ability to communicate given their technical background.<br/>

                  <br/>

                  <b>Cubic:</b> Communication communication communication! This is what's very important aside of the
                  technical skills. Regardless of whether a candidate is technically qualified, what a good employee has
                  distinction in is their ability to communicate as they are working in order to be productive and
                  produce a favorable work environment. I love questions. One's ability to openly and urgently ask
                  questions shows their interest and urgency to solve their problems. At Cubic, there is only one stupid
                  question and that is the one that isn't asked. The three values I look for in a good applicant is their
                  urgency to produce good work, their openness to communicate, ask questions, and take initiative, and 
                  their ability to take ownership for their work and coming up with original and clever ways to do what 
                  needs to be done to meet a deadline. Anything technical can be learned on the job but good work is
                  presented in one who can communicate it, not necessarily  their technical background. The technical 
                  aspect is just the candidate's toolbox that can be expanded with good communication skills. It is also
                  important to note that what will also impress your interviewer is your knowledge on the software
                  development models since these concepts are heavily used in the industry. Technical skills will not
                  make one stand out as much as having the soft skills to back it up. The technical skills just get your
                  foot in the door.<br/>

                  <br/>
                  
                  From what I see, although technical skills are important, they are only a means of getting into the
                  hiring process. Typically, an applicant will have a vast set of skills but will not perfectly match
                  the set of skills the company needs. These skills however can be learned on the job and what determines
                  how well a candidate can learn these skills is not just their technical background, but the addition of
                  their work ethic displayed by how well they can communicate. There are several engineers out there with
                  distinct technical skills. What makes one memorable on top of their technical skills set is their 
                  ability to communicate effectively. It is an act of selling what one has to work with that can foreshadow 
                  how well they will work on a team given a qualified technical background.<br/>
