                	"Dynamic allocation is frowned upon!" This was an interesting statement I was told at work. I spent four years in UCSD learning
                	strictly about dynamic allocation as if it's a vital skill to harness in the work force. This actually is the case but more
                	importantly, for the purpose of understanding memory management behind the scenes in C++ without taking it for granted. Given
                	the possible array of errors that can arise from dynamic allocation such as memory leaks, dangling pointers, and page faults,
                	there is a way to avoid this given the level and size of programming in the industry. Shortening one's subset of contingent
                	errors will prove to be useful anywhere. I am talking specifically about smart pointers, an abstraction in C++ that contains
                	all the black boxes for traditional pointers easing the programmer from having to explicitly manage them in order to prevent
                	errors. The following are some problematic examples of using traditional pointers:<br/>
                	<div class="codebox">
                		<font style="font-family:'Courier New'" color="lime">
                			<font color="blue">/* If the call to function results in an exception, a double delete would lead to a heap corruption error. */<br/></font>
                			ptr * foo1 = <font color="orange">new</font> ptr();<br/>
                			foo1->function();<br/>
                			<font color="orange">delete</font> foo1;<br/>
                			<br/>
                			<font color="blue">/* Assigning the value of i results into a page fault since a pointee wasn't assigned. */<br/></font>
                			<font color="darkgreen">int</font> * i;<br/>
                			*i = <font color="red">1</font>;<br/>
                			<br/>
                			<font color="blue">/* If the call to my_error is true, foo would become a dangling pointer causing the call to function
                			to result into a page fault. Otherwise, foo2 would not be deleted causing a memory leak. */<br/></font>
                			ptr * foo2 = <font color="orange">new</font> ptr();<br/>
                			<br/>
                			<font color="orange">if</font>(my_error()) {<br/>
                			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="orange">delete</font> foo2;<br/>
                			}<br/>
                			<br/>
                			foo2->function();
                		</font>
                	</div>

                	<br/>

                	In industry level programs, the possibility of the above errors become such a nuisance when debugging. Smart pointers remove the
                	need for explicitly managing pointers thereby, preventing any of the above scenarios and others. The two types of basic smart
                	pointers are <font style="font-family:'Courier New'">unique_ptr</font> and <font style="font-family:'Courier New'">shared_ptr</font>.
                	As the names suggests, the former is used to limit the number of pointers to one whereas the latter will allow multiple copies
                	to exists. Which pointer you decide to use depends on whether you want to limit or extend the scope or implement a singleton instance
                	of an object. To use these pointers, simply declare one using a smart pointer type along with a template to specify what type or
                	object to point to. To initialize, explicitly call the appropriate constructor on the declaration. Example below:<br/>
                	<div class="codebox">
                		<font style="font-family:'Courier New'" color="lime">
                			<font color="purple">#include</font> <font color="red">&lt;memory&gt;</font> <font color="blue">/* Include this header file to use smart pointers */</font><br/>
                			<br/>
                			<font color="darkgreen">int</font> main() {<br/>
                			<font color="blue">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/* A smart pointer to an int with value 1 is created. */</font><br/>
                			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;std :: unique_ptr&lt;<font color="darkgreen">int</font>&gt; i(<font color="orange">new</font> <font color="darkgreen">int</font>(<font color="red">1</font>));<br/>
                			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="orange">return</font> <font color="red">0</font>;<br/>
                			}<br/>
                			<font color="blue">/* Note: A shared_ptr (same syntax) is ideal for a field; the errors mentioned above are implicitly taken care of. */</font>
                		</font>
                	</div>

					<b>Hash Table</b> - a hashcode algorithm is performed to store values in indeces; supports collisions caused by common hash value and duplicate insert<br/>
                    <b>Interface</b> - cannot be instantiated; contains only method signatures; must be implemented for use; multiple interfaces can be implemented<br/>
					<b>Linked List</b> - dynamically allocated linear structure not relying on indexing<br/>
					<b>Memory</b> - there are four sections of memory<br/>

					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;classes, etc.<br/>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Data</b> - contains virtual addresses corresponding to the program as well as global<br/> 
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;variables and static fields<br/>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Heap</b> - contains dynamically allocated variables and instances of objects<br/>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Stack</b> - contains functions, arguments, and local variables in a LIFO container<br/> 
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;where a stack frame is popped off and out of scope when a function returns;<br/> 
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;each frame corresponds to a function<br/>
					<b>Monitor</b> - concurrent synchronization construct for concurrent programming relying on condition variable to allow a producer and consumer to modify a buffer<br/>
					<b>Mutex</b> - a mutual exclusion object that serves to lock and unlock concurrent processes and threads to and from the CPU to prevent data race in what is determined to be the
					critical section in the program<br/>
					<b>MVC</b> - model view controller design pattern; separates visual components(view), logic to initiate interaction(model), and what events to listen for 
					to execute an interactive process(controller); typically used in but not limited to web applications<br/>
                    <b>Object</b> - an instance of a class containing variables as data fields and access to the functions to either modify or access a field in the class; found in the heap<br/>
					<b>Object Oriented Programming</b> - programming paradigm involving the idea of separating modules into objects based on related functionality; objects contain data fields
					and functions to access or modify their fields; object reference creates instance of class when instantiating; there are "four pillars to object oriented programming"<br/>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Encapsulation</b> - hiding details of data fields from other classes<br/>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Abstraction</b> - showing essential features of an application but preventing direct<br/>

					<b>Process</b> - an instance of execution of concurrent executions that do not share addresses nor registers<br/>
					<b>Round Robin</b> - a preemptive scheduling algorithm that assigns sections of a thread or process priority to use the CPU<br/>
					<b>SDLC</b> - stands for software development life cycle, a set of stages in the software development process for a particular project starting from requirements and
					ending to release<br/>
					<b>Semaphore</b> - a concurrency mechanism that relies on a counter to either signal a process, or let it wait; changes between wait to signal depend on whether the counter
					has fully decremented to 0<br/>
					<b>Static</b> - fixed size allocation of memory in the data section of memory; global in scope; function or field that is static must be called without instance of an object<br/>
					<b>Template</b> - a container that assigns an arbitrary primitive and/or object for a class or struct to implement<br/>
					<b>Thread</b> - a unit of a process that shares addresses and registers of another thread within the same process<br/>
					<b>Virtual Function</b> - a function defined in a base class to be redefined in a derived class; explicitly referring to a virtual function executes the derived class's function<br/>
					<b>Virtual Memory</b> - abstracted memory mapped to limited physical memory to give user the illusion of a large amount of memory; quantified by number of addresses; less physical addresses,
					more virtual addresses<br/>
					<b>Void Pointer</b> - a pointer to anything; cannot be dereferenced; can be used in place of templates to implement polymorphic generic containers<br/>

                	Styling conventions in C/C++ generally separate function definitions/ class templates and their implementations. Although clean in nature, this convention poses a problem with templates. Interestingly, I was told by my data structures professor that templated classes require implementations to be defined in the header files, a contradiction of the convention I previously mentioned. It is also interesting to note that this professor would agree with the said convention. Why was this a problem with templated classes? Do templated classes necessarily have to go against this styling convention in order to compile? The simple answer is no. Templated classes can still follow best practices in code organization remaining consistent with non-templated classes. My professor's claim that implementing templated classes in the header file is therefore inaccurate. The problem has to do with the compiler not knowing how to interpret what to pass into the template. At compile time, the type(s) that are expected to be passed into the template need to be defined. For objects, operators
                	would need to be overloaded and their classes would need to be implemented in order for the template to know how to use them.<br/><br/>

                   When the code compiles, the compiler would need access to the implementation at the time the function definition is read. If this is not defined
                   in the header file, the compiler would not have access in knowing the types of classes that would need to be created thus, lead to a "function undefined"
                   compiler error. However, it is possible to isolate the implementation from the header files of templated classes in order to maintain code
                   cleanliness. There are two solutions.<br/><br/>

                	In general, there's a set of common classes to take among any university for a bachelor's degree in computer science.
                	One should definitely expect the following set of math classes:<br/><br/>
                	<b>Calculus I:</b> fundamental theory of calculus involving limit definitions of differentiation and integration<br/>
                	<b>Calculus II:</b> advanced integration techniques; sequences and series to solve mathematical expressions; polar graphing<br/>
                	<b>Calculus III:</b> application of Calculus I in 3-dimensional space, equation systems, and vectors<br/>

                	<b>Discrete Mathematics:</b> analysis of advanced algebraic techniques and introduction to number theory and mathematics for systems<br/><br/>
                	Since computer science involves a highly systematic way of thinking, these math classes are chosen for to curriculum to train one's mindset into
                	the proper conventional thought process for systems as well as the possibility of applying mathematical theory to solving any problems that can be encountered
                	in the field of computation. The next set of following classes involve the typical order and content to expect when studying for a computer science 
                	degree:<br/><br/>
                	<b>Introduction to UNIX-like Systems:</b> basic UNIX command semantics and use of a CLI<br/>
                	<b>Introduction to Programming and OOD:</b> basic programming features and applications of object oriented design practice for code readability<br/>

                	<b>Programming Paradigms:</b> varying programming styles involving functional, logical, scripting, and specific programming languages and analysis<br/><br/>
                	By the time this major is finished, one should know how to use a UNIX or UNIX-like system for business and development. One will be able to write code with best 
                	practices as well as implement common industry protocols for project development and team collaboration. One understands how code is translated to low level execution
                	with respect to CPU architecture and digital design. One has a good understanding of algorithms to solve problems including but not limited to concurrent programming.
                	One will also know multiple programming styles in addition to the traditional procedural and object oriented design paradigms. These are all the basics one must know
                	in order to work in the industry utilizing their computer science degree. These basics should also preferably be applied to multiple specific disciplines within computer
                	science. The following set of classes are some electives one can consider but are not limited to:<br/><br/>

                   Looking for a job? Trying to get your career started? Looking to expand your network, learn about new opportunities, or
                   to get to know more companies that are looking for you? Attending a career fair is a great way to address any of the above
                   desires. To get the most out of your career fair experience, here are 9 tips that have been explained by those who run
                   the quarterly Triton Career Fair at UCSD:<br/><br/>
                   <b>1. Have healthy expectations</b><br/>
                   Don't expect that you will be successful with whatever top tech company is your top
                   choice. Also understand that the more competitive companies will have longer lines that can have you waiting for over an
                   hour. You should ask yourself if it's worth it to invest all that time waiting in line for one company rather than
                   exploring around. In general, don't put all your eggs in one basket. You want to expand your options. The point of
                   attending a career fair is to expand your employment opportunities in addition to meeting with employers face to face
                   and expanding your network. Also, understand that attending career fairs does not necessarily give you a higher probability
                   of landing a job over mass applying online. The advantage is mainly networking and educating yourself about open
                   opportunities.<br/><br/>
                   <b>2. Bring several copies of your updated resume</b><br/>
                   It is better to have too much than too little copies of your physical resume. The last thing you want is to run out of copies
                   with the presence of potential employers you have yet to talk to. I normally bring at least 20 copies.<br/><br/>
                   <b>3. Do your research on the companies attending</b><br/>
                   Want to know about companies you are aiming to work for? Do your research on the given list of companies attending. 
                   This also lets employers know that you are
                   interested in them by taking the time to learn about their companies as well as give you something to talk about. When
                   researching, it is best to start at their website. Look for the essentials; their mission statement, what they do, and who they
                   serve. Read up on some articles to expand your research and/ or find a Wiki page or blog about them to expand your knowledge.
                   Try to find out their technical background and process if you can as well as any soft skills and principles they value. After 
                   you learned a thing or two, figure out how you can positively impact their company with the skill set you have to offer by
                   looking for ties in your resume and their expectations. It also helps to apply online beforehand.<br/><br/>
                   <b>4. Rank employers you want to meet</b><br/>
                   It is good practice to keep a spreadsheet ranking the companies you want to meet. Do your research and prioritize what you are
                   personally looking for. This can include culture, type of work, company perks, benefits, salary, location, etc. Ask yourself
                   where you would want to work and why. Obviously don't actually talk about benefits. You are not yet in the position to be
                   negotiating your compensation when talking to the employers. Also be sure to factor in the expected amount of time you will
                   be in line for a company.<br/><br/>
                   <b>5. Practice your elevator pitch</b><br/>
                   Usually, employers will ask you to tell them a little about yourself. Being confident shows good character and helps the
                   employers remember you later. This confidence comes with practice. Come up with an outline of your technical background,
                   what you are looking for, and how you can contribute, and rehearse it. Learn to communicate it effectively and confidently
                   but be humble. Practice your flow. It doesn't take that much time to practice a 30-45 second elevator pitch.<br/><br/>
                   <b>6. Manage your time wisely</b><br/>
                   Make sure you can meet as much of your higher prioritized companies. Show up as early as possible to get as much time as
                   you need. Some lines take over an hour of waiting. Ask yourself whether it's worth it to wait that long. A long wait can be
                   time wasted that could've been spent talking to other companies. Also, don't spend too much time talking to one company. Be
                   brief in explaining your highlights. Remember that employers are trying to give everyone an equal chance to talk to them. Also,
                   taking too long with a employer can have negative consequences. They may not appreciate you taking a significant chunk of their
                   time in addition to wasting your own time.<br/><br/>
                   <b>7. Dress for success</b><br/>
                   The dress doesn't make the person but if you can, do it. I gives the employer a sense of respectability of your character
                   knowing that you took the time to dress well to talk to them.<br/><br/>
                   <b>8. Ask for contact information and follow up along with a "thank you"</b><br/>
                   Increase your chances of getting an interview and the employers remembering you by asking for business cards and contact information
                   with intention to follow up a week later. Be sure to mention anything significant from the past conversation that can help you land 
                   an interview. Also, thank them for their time. It shows that you are respectable.<br/><br/>
                   <b>9. Be prepared</b><br/>
                   Have a folder handy to hold your resumes, a pen to write with (having a pen ready makes a good impression), and some paper to take
                   important notes. Having a tablet at hand is a plus if you can use it to show the employers relevant work, perhaps your online portfolio
                   if you have one.<br/><br/>
                   Overall, be courteous, be professional, be prepared, and be humble. Make sure you are there for the right reasons.

                   This blog post is an extension of <a href="blog_2.html#13">Resume tips</a> if you have not read up on that post yet. I attended
                   a career fair prep event where I got my resume critiqued thanks to <a href="https://act.ucsd.edu/directory/search?search-scope=directory&entry=melissa+hoon&site=career" target="_blank">
                   Melissa Hoon</a>, a UCSD Career Center staff member. In addition to my previous post on Resumes, here are some more tips from her:<br/><br/>
                   - include objective with buzz words (specific type of job you're looking for + location; be brief (1 - 2 phrases), enthusiastic, and state the skills you have to offer)<br/>
                   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This contradicts my previous post.<br/> 
                   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Objectives make it clear what job<br/> 
                   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you're looking for and serve as a<br/>
                   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; small elevator pitch to sell yourself.<br/>
                   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, there's no need to go<br/>
                   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; overboard. Conserve space for the rest<br/>
                   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of your content.<br/>
                   - make room for the content that sells you (expand margins; limit spaces and font sizes; use columns, footers, headers; etc. make it work on one page)<br/>
                   - communicate effectively (make your content state the impact you made rather than it being task based)<br/>
                   - descriptions typically start with verbs (actions) and are structured as (action making impact -> using these technical and or soft skills)<br/>
                   - include buzz words for soft skills; important to compliment your tech skills (leadership, communication, collaboration, etc.)<br/>
                   - include <b>HOW</b> the skills in your skill set section developed with projects<br/>
                   - data/ metrics are a plus; try to include concrete numerical data where applicable<br/>
                   - include relevant project subsection in employment section if directly relevant<br/>
                   - any outside work, label as "relevant experience"<br/>
                   - .pdf is an ideal format when including your resume to a job application (use <a href="https://pdftotext.com/" target="_blank">ATS</a> to see if it parses all your resume's text)<br/>
                   - format hyperlinks to make it obvious they are links<br/>
                   - organize sections of your resume in a way that is easy to differentiate each of them<br/>
                   - be consistent in how you label/ indent sections and subsections of your resume based on its structure<br/>
                   - prioritize top to bottom the following order (objective -> skills -> education -> work -> relevant experience etc.)<br/><br/>

                   Here is the before and after of my current resume given my previous tips, and Melissa's tips respectively:<br/><br/>
                   <b>Before:</b><br/>
                   <object width="100%" height="1050px" data="IResume.pdf"></object><br/><br/>
                   <b>After:</b><br/>
                   <object width="100%" height="1050px" data="MyResume.pdf"></object><br/><br/>

                   <b>Changes</b><br/>
                   The most obvious one is that I found a way to move my skill set to the top with the use of columns. Also, listing them vertically
                   makes it easier for a recruiter to see what all my skills are versus listing them horizontally. For the margins, they are now 
                   expanded. Hyperlinks are now noticeable. For the content, I moved some of my projects to the experience section since they are
                   directly related to the organization. "Projects" is now labeled with "Relevant" to emphasize the urgency for a recruiter consider them. I also focused on adding more metrics
                   and communicating the impacts I made rather than the task I did in addition to my skill applications. The added content made
                   me have to limit spaces and font sizes. The expanded margins also helped make space. Lastly, I added a brief objective stating
                   the line of work I am looking for with what I have to offer.

                   It is usually good practice to create a single HTML file for a specific component that will be used by multiple HTML files.
                   This way, HTML source can be reused and the component will only need to be edited once for reliable consistency when other
                   HTML files refer to it. There are two ways to do this:<br/><br/>
                   <b>jQuery</b><br/>
                   Your main file must include jQuery from the exact following url: 
                   <font style="font-family:'Courier New'">http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.10.2.js</font>. A div class or id should be placed
                   where the content of the included file will be loaded. Include a script that uses the load function from jQuery. It takes
                   the name of the included file as an argument. The calling reference will be the div tag's id or class attribute value. 
                   Notice that in this example, the '#' character is used for the "id" attribute. Be sure to use '.' for "class".<br/>
                   <img src="html1.png" width="100%"></img><br/><br/>
                   The included file's body will be loaded to the main file's div tag attribute that called the load function.<br/>
                   <img src="html2.png" width="100%"></img><br/><br/>
                   <b>W3S</b><br/>
                   Sometimes, jQuery doesn't work given certain frameworks as sources. W3S is an alternative choice of framework to accomplish
                   this task. Similarly to jQuery, the body of the included file will be loaded to the main file. First off, W3S will need to be 
                   included into your source.<br/>
                   <img src="w3s.png" width="100%"></img><br/><br/>
                   In order to specify where to place the components of the included file, use the "w3-include-html" attribute with the name of
                   the included file as the value.
                   <img src="w3include.png" width="100%"></img><br/><br/>
                   To get the contents to load, you need the JavaScript source to load it as well as a script to call the JavaScript.
                   <img src="includescript.png" width="100%"></img><br/><br/>
                   <img src="caller.png" width="100%"></img><br/><br/>

                   After a wonderful two years of balancing school, work, and side commitments, Solar Interact comes to a close; at least for its
                   first release. With all members of the team graduated with the exception of one programmer, the final build is released and
                   available for use at the UCSD Sustainability Resource Center. Currently, one programming student is planning to extend the 
                   product's current capabilities and continue the project for the future generation of Engineers for a Sustainable World.<br/><br/>
                   
                   During
                   the process of coming up with our first MVP, the software team has encountered several roadblocks. The way I like to think of
                   this experience is by the motto, "You either win, or you learn". Given these roadblocks, the team definately learned a lot
                   about Android development until we succeeded. Below, I document the software team's roadblocks and their solutions:<br/><br/>

                   <b>1. Build failures</b><br/>
                   This problem happened everytime Google released an update for Android Studio. Typically, the solution was to update the top
                   level gradle that the build relies on. Updates come with release notes that typically document how to update the gradle
                   file to work with the new dev environment. This would involve updating repositories, and the class path:<br/>

                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dependencies {<br/>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="grey">// make sure the path is correct (typically the version #)<br/></font>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:3.2.0'<br/>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br/>
                        }<br/>
                        <br/>
                        allprojects {<br/>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;repositories {<br/>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="grey">// keep these dependencies updated<br/></font>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;jcenter()<br/>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;google()<br/>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br/>
                        }
                      </font> 
                   </div>
                   <br/><br/>
                   <b>2. Circular dependency</b><br/>
                   We had problems building the APK due to a circular dependency. The graphview API was responsible for this as well as
                   myself learning how to incorporate the API into our project. There are two ways to include the API and <b>ONLY</b> 
                   one of them should be done:<br/>
                   Add the following to the dependencies block in the build.gradle file from the "app" directory:<br/>
                   <font style="font-family:'Courier New'">implementation 'com.jjoe64:graphview:4.2.2'</font><br/>
                   -- or --<br/>
                   Clone "https://github.com/jjoe64/GraphView.git", select File > Import Module followed by the folder that contains
                   the repository, and add <font style="font-family:'Courier New'">implementation project(':GraphView')</font> into the dependencies block.<br/><br/>
                   <b>3. Incorrect values for power outputs</b><br/>
                   Bluetooth sockets accomplish communication of data in byte buffers which are framed and parsed by character making it problematic for
                   values with multiple digits. Logic would need to be added to ensure that every digit of an individual value is considered before
                   being read.<br/><br/>
                   <b>4. Slow graph</b><br/>
                   The problem was from calling the <font style="font-family:'Courier New'">AppendData(DataPoint, scrollToEnd, maxPoints, silent)</font> function.
                   The maxPoints parameter is the maximum number of data points a line can have. The garbage collector deletes old data points. This value
                   was set too high causing memory bloat. There has to be a limit to how many data points can be seen on the graph. Luckily, the graph automatically
                   scales and moves along axes for the data.<br/><br/>
                   <b>5. Bad USB cable/ port<br/></b>
                   This has always been a problem for me as an Android developer. Emulators were the solution. However, emulators do not support Bluetooth connection.
                   We had to repeatedly build an APK and email it to the device. However, debugging was unavailable rendering us required to put print
                   statements within the app and going through several trial an error.<br/><br/>
                   <b>6. Map crashing<br/></b>
                   The .jpg file for the map was high-res. It turned out that the device did not have enough memory to load it. To make it work for our final
                   build, we had to lower the resolution of the image despite an HD image being a nice feature.<br/><br/>
                   <b>What's the plan now?<br/></b>
                   As I stated earlier, there are plans to extend the product's current features that the future generation of ESW members can take care of. One of
                   our programmers is planning on adding land marks to the map as well as the ability to store business hours and let users know whether something is
                   closed or about to close. There is also room to make the app itself more aesthetically pleasing. For the Solar Interact game, it would be nice to
                   be able to save the top scores. I originally wanted to work on this feature but class work and graduation beat me to it.<br/><br/> 
                   Overall, I have learned
                   a lot of Android development skills as well as knowledge of several API's from this project. I also learned soft skills involving leading the
                   development cycle of software projects to ensure quality builds. Some of these soft skills involve unit testing, automation, code review,
                   documentation, communication, and agile scrum. I plan to take note of everything I learned on the next chapter of my career as a software
                   engineer.<br/><br/>

					          I was tasked with working on a Socket based cloud storage application when I encountered a file I/O error. I noticed a few
                  	ASCII files being unread after certain areas in the text and binary files not being read at all. I also noticed several reading
                  	errors on Unicode text files. Knowing that the char data type in C only supports 8-bit ASCII, I believed the lack of bit space
                  	was causing the error. This was definitely the case for parsing Unicode files. However, this was irrelevant to the misread
                  	issue on ASCII encoded files. Taking care of 16-bit characters would just be a later task for me but it didn't add up to me why some files encoded
                  	with 8-bit character schemes were not being read. The issue was pointed out by a fellow senior software engineer at work. <b>The
                  	'0' character is ambiguous. When inputting characters into my message buffers, there was no way to for a char array to tell
                  	the difference between the numerical value 0 and the null character.</b> This explained why binary files were not being read at all
                  	and why certain characters were not being read from ASCII files. They were null characters. I learned the following lessons from this error:<br/><br/>
                  	1. <b>DO NOT</b> use char buffers when parsing files. Use the <font style="font-family:'Courier New'">stat</font> struct defined in the C library.<br/>
                  	2. Use the <font style="font-family:'Courier New'">sendfile</font> system call to efficiently and reliably parse all file contents 
                  	instead of using <font style="font-family:'Courier New'">fgetc</font> and <font style="font-family:'Courier New'">fputc</font> to parse
                  	characters at a time.<br/></br>
                  	This video taught me how to use the <font style="font-family:'Courier New'">sendfile</font> system call.<br/><br/>
