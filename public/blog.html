	          I have always had this burning question before I got into the industry. With CS being<br/>
		  a rather abstract field of study, what does one actually do in the work force with all<br/>
		  the abstract concepts in mind? First of all, I would like to make very clear that<br/>
		  EVERYTHING one does in their course work is vital to their career. While some aspect<br/>
		  in college may be directly or indirectly beneficial, every task is tied to each other<br/>
		  and builds on itself. Any curriculum is built in its own unique way to educate aspiring<br/>
		  engineers through time, addressing specific goals. To answer the question of what happens<br/>
		  in the industry, expect projects as far as the eye can see to come under way, as well as<br/>
		  the expectation of teamwork to accomplish large scale projects. Whether it is a basic<br/>
		  application, some back end database, or complicated network system, a CS degree's worth<br/>
		  of skills to be used as one's toolbox is more than enough to answer an endless array<br/>
		  of problems. To put it simply, college curriculums aim to allow engineers to grow<br/>
		  overtime with the expectation that all information will be tied together in the end<br/>
		  and can be recalled and utilized in some fashion to answer the consumer's need.<br/>
		  College is all building, and practicing, with due dates simulating a consumer's<br/> 
		  actual time of need for a product, and one's grade simulating how the consumer reacts<br/> 
		  to one's work. Also, studying is aquiring one's unique engineering toolbox while<br/>
		  working is applying that toolbox to address a consumer's problem. However, what is<br/>
		  physically done in school, one can expect it to be done in the industry as well.<br/>

               <center><font size="5px" style="color:blue">
                  The study of computer science is defined by the scientific approach to answer<br/>
                  the problems of computation, the way that computers solve problems. Normally,<br/>
                  one would expect this degree to lead them to a software engineering career however,</br>
                  the main take away I would like to point out is that software engineering is only<br/>
                  one out of many specific branches of computer science, one which is highly marketable<br/> 
                  in the industry. While one's expectation in a nutshell is that a CS degree leads to a<br/>
                  six figure career, one must understand that this is not the case GENERALLY speaking<br/>
                  of the field of computer science. I will discuss from my experience what this field<br/>
                  of study actually is in a general sense rather than it being associated to a high<br/>
                  paying job. As I have noted earlier, computer science is a scientific mean of<br/>
                  computation. That is to say, the scientific method is actually used to solve the<br/>
                  problem of how to compute. Formerly, I misconstrued why this was considered science<br/>
                  but back then, my only experience at the time was coding, only one out of many aspects<br/> 
                  of computer science. When taking part in this field of study, one should expect three<br/>
                  main branches of computation. That is software, hardware, and theory. The most obvious<br/>
                  branch is software, anything that has to do with code and abstraction. This where I<br/>
                  felt I missed the understanding of this field being a science. Coding is more of an<br/>
                  application or toolbox to actively address a problem of computation. How does the code<br/>
                  actually work in a physical level? That brings me to the branch of hardware, particularly<br/>
                  digital design. This focuses on how to physically create the CPU to be programmed to solve<br/>
                  computable problems. This branch focuses on how to use signals on and off for a computer<br/>
                  to physically execute what the code tells it to do. How has all of this been figured out<br/>
                  to this day? This brings me to the theoretical branch of computer science. Every idea is<br/>
                  a theory until proven and put into practice. The theory branch is where most of the science<br/>
                  exists. It attempts to answer computation questions; what is solvable, how to solve it, and<br/>
                  how efficient it can be. A lot of algorithms and their efficiencies is studied in this<br/>
                  branch as well as a lot of hypothesis being tested. The theory of computation addresses<br/>
                  computing models to attempt to solve problems before the machine is built (hardware)<br/>
                  and code is given to it to put the solution into practice (software). All together, we<br/>
                  have the field of computer science.

                  What I am about to explain is a theory that is not necessarily accurate nor is it by any<br/>
                  means proven to be true. Capitalism, or some like to call it, a means of opportunity; as<br/>
                  implied by "opportunity", there are those that achieve it while there are as those who<br/> 
                  are exploited by it. A generic example to clarify this would be any competative game,<br/> 
                  one that features a winner and a loser. That being said, capitalism has those whom are<br/> 
                  victorious and those who must work to make it up to victory. In a nutshell, to keep an economy<br/> 
                  that features free opportunity to socio-economic gain stable, there must be spenders in order to<br/> 
                  make capitalistic gain possible for the winners of the game. How does college play a role<br/> 
                  in this kind of society? It is actually more of an economic buffer than a provider of industrial<br/>
                  competencies. Generally, we only use 20% of what we learn in school as an application. After<br/>
                  13 years of school, one can only recall a handful of concepts but still competently live their<br/>
                  life. For example, out of math, the only means we use as an application are mathematical<br/>
                  oprations. From science, we indirectly use the scientific method. We learn some language<br/> 
                  just enough to the point of useful communication. Specifically as a CS student in college, one<br/>
                  can theoretically get by in the industry as a software engineer with a decent knoledge in some<br/>
                  programming languages, algorithms, and soft skills. Essentially, this can be achieved in a<br/> 
                  year rather than 4. One may argue that only those basic skills alone won't make one marketable.<br/> 
                  I will get to that later but theoretically, one can do the job of a software engineer with<br/> 
                  those basic skills while the rest are only specific applications that one either happens to<br/> 
                  know, or can be looked up whenever needed. Why do we spend all this time in school possesing<br/> 
                  a poor ratio of learned to applied concepts with what we study? One theory is economic<br/> 
                  stability. It is designed for a group of people, typically the younger ones, to be encouraged<br/> 
                  to spend money which will keep the economy moving and beneficial for those earning money. In<br/> 
                  capitalism, there must be spenders that gainers benefit from. This explains why society<br/> 
                  encourages an extended amount of time for the youth to be in school and is independent of<br/> 
                  whether these individuals can win in the capitalistic nature of the economy by being<br/> 
                  industrially qualified. In other words, a lot of the college degree is a rite of passage,<br/> 
                  the proof that one has spent their dues in school funds and is elligible for a role in the<br/> 
                  economy to finally make a good salary. To answer the argument that only knowing a limited<br/> 
                  amount of skills regardless of being applicable, will not make one a likely candidate for<br/> 
                  a job, this is an example of how the capitalistic economy urges one to spend money before<br/> 
                  landing a role in the economy that makes money. Although one's schooling and degree may have<br/> 
                  some significance in learning how to become industrially competent, that is only a limited<br/> 
                  part of it. The other part is maintaining economic stability by urging people to contribute<br/> 
                  money before being paid to contribute to society. Whether I completely agree with this<br/> 
                  theory is outside of my intentions of this blog post.<br/>

                  <br/>

                  The next thing I would like to discuss is an example that may assess this thoery by<br/> 
                  explaining how my resume has evolved over time. To clarify, I will not be talking<br/> 
                  about how my resume got better in terms of its content moreover, I will be focusing<br/> 
                  on how my resume changed as I spent more tuition money to earn my right into a software<br/> 
                  engineering job. The point I would like to make is the increment in my social title<br/> 
                  suggested by my resume based on a quantity of dollars that I contributed to a capitalistic<br/> 
                  economy. Below are links to iterations of my resume tantamount to my time and money<br/> 
                  spent in education:<br/>

                  <br/>
                  
                  <div class="click"><a href="ResumeFirst.pdf" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none">See resume 1<br/></a></div>
                  Tuition money spent: $0.00<br/>
                  - a lot of buffer content to fill one page (ie. objective, addresses)<br/>
                  - soft skills with description to fill space<br/>
                  - no employment; masked with "Professional Experience"<br/> 
                  - only containing volunteer work and extracurriculars<br/>
                  - awards only have to do with high school accomplishments<br/>
                  - extra curricular activities is a section<br/>
                  - references is a section<br/>
                 
                  <br/>

                  <div class="click"><a href="Resume Google.pdf" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none">See resume 2<br/></a></div>
                  Tuition money spent: $27827.78<br/>
                  - professional summary added as an improvement from objective<br/>
                  - list of technical skills without applications<br/>
                  - employment present<br/>
                  - professional organizations present<br/>
                  - contains basic projects<br/>

                  <br/>

                  <div class="click"><a href="SEIResume.pdf" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none">See resume 3<br/></a></div>
                  Tuition money spent: $35201.63<br/>
                  - professional summary removed to make space<br/>
                  - more content and technical applications in professional history<br/>
                  - list of skills with applications<br/>
                  - removed references section to make space<br/>

                  <br/>

                  <div class="click"><a href="PSEResume.pdf" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none">See current resume<br/></a></div>
                  Tuition money spent: $49131.65<br/>
                  - contains hyperlinks<br/>
                  - removed fast food job<br/>
                  - added internship experience<br/>
                  - removed irrelavant certifications<br/>
                  - projects are more large scale and specific<br/>
                  - format of skills changed to make space<br/>

                  <br/>

                  The trend I see here is that over time, I have been able to remove insignificant concepts<br/>
                  from my resume to make space for more relavant and larger scale experiences as I invest<br/>
                  more time and money towards my degree. Once again, I would like to thank Daniel Quinn<br/>
                  for this idea.
