                   Before using your hard drive, you typically need to allocate space and assign each allocated space to a
                   particular purpose in order for your OS to gain access to it. By default, there are usually partitions
                   for recovery purposes or anything that has to do with system embedded software. If you are nit picky
                   about organizing your hard drive like myself, it may be in your favor to partition your hard drive(s) in
                   a way that you find organized by allocating specific areas for whatever general data you want that area for. 
                   Also, it is favorable to make sure you are actually using all the space
                   you need that is installed in your system. If you want to make a multiboot system, partitioning will also
                   need to be done to allocate space for specific operating systems. OS installers normally prompt users to
                   a hard drive partitioning menu. In windows, you can use the "Computer Management" app or type in 
                   "diskmgmt.msc" in the DOS prompt to access the app. You might need to run it as administrator since you
                   are modifying system hardware. The app looks like the following:<br/><br/>
                   <img src=Partition.PNG width="100%" height="100%"/><br/><br/>
                   To partition, you simply right click on any unallocated area and allocate some if not all the space left.
                   However, it is preferable to do this prior to installing an operating system in order to prevent space
                   gaps once a system is already installed. Also, partitioning on already allocated areas <b>WILL</b> format that
                   area in your hardrive so be careful and <b>BACK UP</b> all your data before attempting to do any repartitioning.
                   Anything with unallocated space is however safe to touch.

                   We have all gone through the insatiably repetitive task of updating and proof reading our resumes
                   in order to maximize the quality of how we sell ourselves to the industry. Before I go into the few 
                   tips I'd like to share about writing resumes, I would like to mention a few principles to consider
                   regarding resumes. First off, your resume is your marketing tool therefore, it is vital that it
                   goes through substantial edits and feedback from multiple eyes. Everyone has different ideas for
                   what makes a resume good but the ideas that matter are those who have the recruiting power. Thus, the more people
                   you can get to review your resume, the more information you have on marketing yourself optimally
                   to the perspective of others. Another point to mention is that a recruiter will spend an average
                   of 5-10 seconds looking at your resume so plan accordingly to best communicate your experience
                   and format in a quick read friendly way. Now to discuss some tips on writing your resume:
                   <br/><br/>
                   - adopt a mindset that you can never write the perfect resume and be prepared to take constructive
                   criticism; the more flexible you are, the better ability you have in writing a good resume<br/>
                   - NO MORE than one page; if it's over a page, it's a CV so make it work<br/>
                   - avoid having a high concentrated area of text in order to make your resume more desirable to read
                   within a few seconds<br/>
                   - it helps to bold keywords<br/>
                   - numerical metrics look good (ie. "design saved 45 watts of power"; "cut costs by 14%"")<br/>
                   - conserve space; you only have a page (only put job relevant information that can actually help your chances of getting hired)<br/>
                   - objectives/ summaries are a waste of space; whatever job you apply for, the recruiter already knows your objective which
                   is obviously to land that job so just get to the point with your skills and experience<br/>
                   - school projects are frowned upon but if you have no other experience, strive to explain your project in a way that
                   APPLIES relevant skills (ie. "implemented autocomplete algorithm for user generated text" rather than "programmed multiway trie")<br/>
                   - go out of your way to do projects; there's plenty of tutorials online that can apply and sharpen your skills<br/>
                   - use "achiever" rather than "doer" statements for your descriptions (ie. "proposed agreement with payroll contractors 
                   slashing labor costs by 10%" rather than "negotiated with payroll contractors")<br/>
                   - send text versions of your resume; there's a good chance that the selection process is computerized and based on
                   keyterms present in resumes; see how your resume looks using <a href="https://pdftotext.com/" target="_blank">ATS</a> (Applicant Tracking System)<br/>
                   - hyperlinks look good for showing proof of your projects but keep the format (don't use hyperlink default format)<br/>
                   - anything you write on your resume is fair game for interview questions so STUDY; the point of your resume is to land 
                   the interview, once that is accomplished, the next step is making sure you are prepared to talk about everything in your resume<br/>
                   - keep resume up-to-date; in the unfortunate event you are unemployed for an extended period, do projects and put them in your resume<br/>

                   microcontroller. From these projects, I learned how to wire an electrical component to an
                   Arduino as well as coding in Arduino's embedded environment through its IDE; in addition to learning some
                   basic analog circuitry required to power the circuit design. Below, I present two links to tutorials that helped
                   me complete these projects:<br/><br/>

                   In my project for <a href="http://eswucsd.weebly.com/solar-chill.html" target="_blank">Solar Chill</a>, I was tasked with building a circuit for a scrolling text that
                   would display the carbon emissions saved over time. We used a dot matrix for the text interface and programmed
                   each individual character to be properly displayed using corresponding dots. Programming text characters was done in C and the display in Arduino's
                   embedded environment.<br/><br/>

                   In my project for <a href="solarinteract.html" target="_blank">Solar Interact</a>, my team of software engineers and my colleague's team of electrical
                   engineers were to collaborate in implementing a communication network through Bluetooth. The electrical team soldered
                   the circuit to send and receive information between Android and Arduino and came up with the embedded software that
                   tells the Arduino the communication protocol. My team of programmers used the Android <a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/connectivity/bluetooth" target="_blank">Bluetooth</a> library in Android studio to communicate with
                   the Arduino. We also implemented a UI that displays the information to the user in the form of a graph using
                   <a href="http://www.android-graphview.org/" target="_blank">Graphview</a> which utilized the Bluetooth sockets for its information.

                      I have recently posted about implementing Wireshark dissectors in Lua. You may have been wondering whether
                      it is possible to include multiple Lua scripts in the main driver in order to keep your Lua code base more
                      organized. This can be accomplished by storing variables and functions within a file to be treated as a class in a dictionary and
                      returning that dictionary. Then from the driver, simply type the <font style="font-family:'Courier New'">require</font> statement and assign it to an alias
                      that treats the calling file as an object and using the alias as an object reference, call the specific
                      function or variable. The <font style="font-family:'Courier New'">require</font> function takes the directory
                      of the file to include as parameter but with "." as a folder separator. <b>DO NOT</b> add ".lua" in the filename. See below for examples:<br/><br/>

					I've been given several tasks involving computer networks. A good tool I've been using is Wireshark, a
					packet sniffing software. This software detects a chosen interface to capture packets from and displays
					the capture information in columns, decoded packet information, and raw data. Columns can be added and
					customized. A user can decode packets as specific protocols. Raw data can be viewed as hex or binary. The GUI
					looks like the following:<br/><br/>
					<img src=wireshark.png height=100% width=100%/><br/><br/>
					What I will be talking about in this blog post is how to create a custom packet detail as seen from the image.
					The packet detail is created based on a dissector typically written in Lua which I will be using for this
					tutorial. The dissector is to conform with how the packet is decoded given the protocol and will decode the 
					payload of a packet to be decoded under that protocol. Dissected output will show in packet detail. Anything
					that is not dissected will be displayed as raw data.<br/><br/>
					<b>Writing the Lua script:</b><br/>
					For Wireshark to detect your Lua scripts, they will need to be stored in the "plugins" directory of Wireshark.
					In Linux, you can find ".wireshark" in the home directory and for Windows in "%appdata%". The first thing to do is
					to create a protocol using the Lua function <font style="font-family:'Courier New'">Proto</font>. This function
					takes a string of the protocol name and a string of its description. Call the <font style="font-family:'Courier New'">
					dissector</font> function on the protocol which takes in the packet buffer, information, and tree as parameters
					which I will explain soon. We then need to add the port using <font style="font-family:'Courier New'">Dissector.get</font>
					followed by mapping it with the protocol using <font style="font-family:'Courier New'">add</font>. See the
					more detailed example below:<br/><br/>
					<font style="font-family:'Courier New'">
					<div class="codebox">
					<font color="blue">-- create a protocol</font><br/>
					<font color="lime">trivial_proto = Proto(<font color="lightblue">"trivial"</font>, <font color="lightblue">"Trivial Protocol"</font>)<br/><br/>
					<font color="blue">-- create the dissector function</font><br/>
					<font color="blue">-- @param: buffer = space in packet to decode;<br/>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pinfo = packet info;<br/> 
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tree = container of buffer and info</font><br/>
					<font color="orange">function</font> trivial_proto.dissector(<font color="lightblue">buffer</font>, <font color="lightblue">pinfo</font>, <font color="lightblue">tree</font>)<br/>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="blue">-- print name of protocol in its column</font><br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pinfo.cols.protocol = <font color="lightblue">"TRIVIAL"</font><br/>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="blue">-- add sub payload into tree</font><br/>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="orange">local</font> subtree = tree:add(trivial_proto, buffer(), <font color="lightblue">"Trivial Protocol Data"</font>)<br/>
					<font color="blue">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- code for dissector goes here</font><br/>
					<font color="orange">end</font><br/><br/>
					<font color="blue">-- create table of ports to catch packets from</font><br/>
					udp_table = DissectorTable.get(<font color="lightblue">"udp.port"</font>)<br/>
					<font color="blue">-- register protocol to table</font><br/>
					udp_table:add(<font color="red">7777</font>, <font color="lightblue">trivial_proto</font>)</font>
					</div>
					</font>
					<br/><br/>
					The above code simply creates a protocol, assumes it comes from port 7777, and decodes accordingly. To understand how dissection
					works, we need to look at the parameters I mentioned earlier:<br/>
					<b>buffer</b> - space allocated specified by bytes where dissection will take place<br/>
					<b>pinfo</b> - fields displayed in the columns in Wireshark; above example uses the "protocol" field<br/>
					<b>tree</b> - protocol section in packet detail; "subtree" is a subsection within the trivial protocol area<br/><br/>
					The packet dissection process will be heavily reliant on the buffer and output the decoded packet in the tree to
					be displayed in the packet detail in Wireshark. "pinfo" is a field you can use to print specific information
					about the packet being dissected. To dissect the raw data, the typical functions to use are:<br/>
					<font style="font-family:'Courier New'">uint()</font> - converts buffer area to numerical output; <b>must be called when outputting bytes</b><br/>
					<font style="font-family:'Courier New'">bitfield(starting_bit, number_bits_to_dissect)</font> - dissects specific bits while converting to numerical output; <b>must not exceed buffer</b><br/><br/>
					These functions are called on the <font style="font-family:'Courier New'">buffer</font> object (parameters are starting byte and how many bytes to go through) that itself takes in numerical
					parameters to highlight which bytes are dissected in raw data. I personally haven't figured out how to highlight bits that are not byte
					aligned. If you figure this out, I would love to hear about it <a href="contact.html" target="_blank">here</a>. If you need to
					make use of information outside of the dissection buffer, you can retrieve that data with <font style="font-family:'Courier New'">Field.new("field.name")</font>.
					Below is an example protocol called "Trivial" and a code snippet for its dissection:<br/><br/>

					<b>Adding core dump:</b><br/>
					If you are planning to record packets for several hours, a neat feature to add is core dump. This is simply giving your
					dissector the ability to spit the dissection in a .csv file to be opened in a spreadsheet. This is useful for looking at
					specific behaviors by values displayed in Excel format. The only concept I am adding here is implementing file I/O in
					Lua. You may find the following functions useful:<br/>
					<font style="font-family:'Courier New'">io.open(file_name,mode)</font> - open a file given by the string name<br/>
					<font style="font-family:'Courier New'">file_name:close()</font> - close the file; <b>end file I/O with this call</b><br/>
					<font style="font-family:'Courier New'">file_name:read()</font> - read file contents<br/>
					<font style="font-family:'Courier New'">file_name_write(content)</font> - write contents to file<br/><br/>
					<b>List of file opening modes:<br/></b>
					"r" - read-only; also default mode<br/>
					"w" - write to file by overriding existing content<br/>
					"a" - append to the file<br/>
					"r+" - read and write<br/>
					"w+" - read and write and overwrite existing file<br/>
					"a" - append and read<br/>

					In this blog post, I will present a tutorial on how to implement a DHCP server on a Juniper firewall using its
					built-in Junos operating system. If you haven't done so yet, please read my blog post on 
					<a href="#6">Juniper operating system</a> as this blog post builds up on that topic. You will need to access the
					configure mode of Junos for this tutorial. Before we begin implementing the server, let's talk about what DHCP
					is. DHCP stands for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol. It is used in a computer network to assign IP addresses
					to devices connected to the server. To understand this, think of an individual computer in a networked system as
					a client. When the client has been configured to request an IP address, it will send a DHCP packet across the network
					assuming there is a DHCP server present. This packet is the client saying "hello I need an IP address". It will
					keep this up continuously until a DHCP server receives the request and sends the client an IP address. The server
					will need to know the mac address of the client in order to know where the request came from to assign accordingly.
					It is also possible to obtain specific IP addresses using a static IP lookup table that maps to given mac
					addresses. In this case, the server will look into this table to see if the mac address it received a DHCP packet
					from is mapped to a specific IP address that is needed. Otherwise, an IP pool (range of usable IP addresses) will 
					be looked into and one that is available will be assigned to the device assuming that the IP pool has been properly
					configured. It is important to note that incorrectly configured IP addresses can result in network errors so please
					choose your assignable IP addresses wisely. The packet looks like the following:<br/><br/>
					<center><img src="DHCP.gif" width="100%" /><br/><br/></center>
					When configuring a DHCP server in Junos, things you need are the IP pool, the lease time, and optionally a static IP
					table if you plan to assign specific IP addresses to specific devices. In configure mode, you will need to enter
					the following commands:<br/><br/>
					<font style="font-family:'Courier New'">
					<div class="codebox">
					<font color="lime">
					<font color="blue"># enable a specific port for DHCP</font><br/>

					Note that you can also configure DHCP in J-Web under "DHCP Server" or directly edit the config file. To 
					check whether DHCP is actually assigning IP addreses, plug in a computer with its IP set to auto and
					check to see if it aquires in IP address.

					I am currently using Linux mint which is based off of Ubuntu. After about three years of owning my
					Alienware 17 R2, I noticed my laptop would randomly power off at times getting more consistent over a
					couple weeks of use. It eventually got to the point where my laptop became unusable. I thought it was
					a software issue at first until I noticed the same problem after booting from a flash drive. From here,
					I diagnosed the temperature, battery, RAM, and GPU in that order. Temperature was normal. The 
					laptop would still power off when plugged in so the battery was not the issue. Normally I would not even
					be able to boot into the OS if RAM was an issue so I skipped this. This left me with the GPU which turned
					out to be the problem. Also, another hint was that this was happening significantly more often in Linux 
					than Windows (The reason for this will be discussed later). At the meantime, I believed there was something
					wrong with the NVIDIA GTX GPU that came with the laptop unfortunately soldered onto the mobo making 
					replacement inefficient. To verify this, I ran extensive graphics tests involving playing HD videos for
					hours with only Intel HD graphics enabled. Interestingly, the laptop managed to stay on for days unless the
					battery died. When I switched back to NVIDIA, the laptop powered off right away leading to my confirmation
					of this being a graphics related issue. For my solution, I simply opened Device Manager on Windows and
					disabled NVIDIA. For Linux, I made sure NVIDIA was running through Driver Manager which originally wasn't
					making me unable to configure the card. Nonetheless, it was still enabled acting as a possible culprit 
					for the crash. I installed Nvidia Prime to be able to select which graphics card to run. The commands work
					as follows:<br/><br/>
					<div class="codebox">
					<font style="font-family:'Courier New'" color="lime">sudo prime-select intel</font> <font color=blue># enable Intel GPU</font><br/>
					<font style="font-family:'Courier New'" color="lime">sudo prime-select nvidia</font> <font color=blue># enable NVIDIA GPU</font><br/>
					<font style="font-family:'Courier New'" color="lime">sudo prime-select query</font> <font color=blue># verify which GPU is enabled</font>
					</div><br/><br/>
					I noticed that on the task bar in Linux, I can see the icon of the GPU that is currently running which
					requires logging out and back in for changes to be applied. I also noticed that running NVIDIA would
					cause Linux Mint to run in fallback mode. In conclusion, I thought simply disabling NVIDIA fixed the 
					problem which appeared to be the case. It turns out that it was a software problem all along, 
					specifically with the Nouveau driver that Linux uses with NVIDIA. After doing some research, I stumbled
					upon the command <font style="font-family:'Courier New'">inxi -G</font> used to output system hardware status with the 'G' flag to specify graphics. I
					was presented with the following output:<br/><br/>
					<div class="codebox"><font style="font-family:'Courier New'" color="lime"><font color="lightblue"><b>Graphics:  Card-1:</font></b> Intel 4th Gen Core Processor Integrated Graphics Controller<br/>

           			</font></div><br/><br/>
           			Notice the "FAILED: nouveau" line. I believed this changed how I should approach this problem. I ran NVIDIA
           			once more but this time ran the proprietary driver for NVIDIA in Driver Manager rather than Nouveau. I ran
           			my graphics tests again with NVIDIA enabled and Nouveau disabled. Miraculously, my laptop stayed on for days
           			running these tests. I tried the same for Windows after enabling this configuration on Linux and got the same
           			results. When I ran the "inxi" command on Linux, the failure was gone. I mentioned the issue to a friend who is more 
           			experienced in hardware and he happened to know about Nouveau and was adamant in assuring me that it's a
           			terrible driver. Looks like the problem was solved. Lesson, <b>DO NOT</b> use Nouveau. Use Nvidia Prime.<br/><br/>
           			In case you have this problem, here are the steps to rectify it:<br/>
           			1. Install Nvidia Prime via <font style="font-family:'Courier New'">sudo apt install nvidia-prime</font>.<br/>
           			2. Open Driver manager. You can also use the command <font style="font-family:'Courier New'">driver-manager</font>.<br/>
           			3. Make sure to enable the proprietary driver for NVIDIA and not Nouveau.<br/>
           			4. Type <font style="font-family:'Courier New'">inxi -G</font> to verify that Nouveau is no longer failing or
           			even enabled.

                      I can personally say that dual booting pretty much saved my life as a computer
		      science student at UCSD having UNIX forced down my throat; not that it's a bad
		      thing. As a programmer, you will need to know how to use the UNIX command line.
		      Typically, students rely on ssh to access their Linux accounts. This has proven
		      to be unreliable to me in a handful of times where connectivity was bad or the
		      server had too many students logged on, normally during an assignment deadline.
		      Also, since you need to know UNIX, why not have a copy of Linux handy on your
		      machine? Today, I present a tutorial on how to dual boot your Windows computer.<br/>

		      <br/>

		      <center>
		      <b>What you will need:</b><br/>
		      Flash drive with enough space<br/>
		      <a href="https://www.pendrivelinux.com/universal-usb-installer-easy-as-1-2-3/" target="_blank">Universal USB installer</a><br/>
		      <b>One</b> of the following ISO files:<br/>
		      <a href="https://www.ubuntu.com/download" target="_blank">Ubuntu ISO file</a><br/>
		      <a href="https://lubuntu.net/downloads/" target="_blank">Lubuntu ISO file</a><br/>
		      <a href="https://xubuntu.org/download/" target="_blank">Xubuntu ISO file</a><br/>
		      <a href="https://kubuntu.org/getkubuntu/" target="_blank">Kubuntu ISO file</a><br/>
		      <a href="https://linuxmint.com/download.php" target="_blank">Mint ISO file</a><br/>
		      **You can use whatever ISO file you want, these are just the one's that I know
		      work for this tutorial.**<br/>
		      Your Windows computer (if you don't already have it)<br/>
		      <br/>
		      </center>

		      If you already have Windows installed, then you're already half way there. If not,
		      you will need to obtain an ISO file for Windows. Simply plug in your flash drive
		      to a computer and drag the Windows ISO file to it. Again, make sure you actually
		      have enough space to do this. Different OS's have different space requirements.
		      Go head and run Universal USB installer once you've downloaded it. It's very straight
		      forward. Select your flash drive by letter, your ISO file, and the appropriate OS
		      from the list. Be sure to have the format hard drive option unchecked unless you want
		      to delete everything from it prior to your installation. This process takes about 2-5
		      minutes. When it's finished, you will notice that your flash drive label has been changed
		      to UUI. When you open it, you will notice all the boot files. It is important you do
		      not modify the locations of any files otherwise, it will not work. Your boot loader
		      looks for the files in your flash drive's root directory. Reboot your computer with
		      the flash drive plugged in. Check your BIOS to see whether you have the boot priority set
		      to find your flash drive. You should then see the setup manager for the Windows installation.
		      Follow directions and be sure to install Windows in an available partition in your hard
		      drive. All you have to do is go through the wizard. When finished, you should have Windows 
		      installed on your computer and should be able to boot into it once you remove your flash
		      drive and reboot your machine. Notice, whenever you need to reformat your Windows partition,
		      you basically have a rescue disk in your flash drive assuming you have backed up all your
		      personal data. I recommend creating a folder in your flash drive and storing all the boot
		      files in there. Whenever you need to install Windows again, simply copy all the files
		      back to the root directory. You will do the same exact procedure to install Linux. If all
		      goes well, you should see the Grub instead of Windows boot manager with a list of all your
		      OS's every time you boot your machine. Typically, Windows must be installed first for this
		      to work. You now have a dual booting machine with Linux natively installed. You also have
		      rescue disks for both of your OS's.<br>

		      <br/>

		      <b>Steps summary:</b><br/>
		      Step 1: Acquire the materials listed above.<br/>
		      Step 2: Install the ISO file to the flash drive with UUI.<br/>
		      Step 3: Reboot your machine with your flash drive plugged in. Check your BIOS if you need to
		      configure your boot priorities.<br/>
		      Step 4: Go through the installation wizard.

                       I have recently been tasked with learning how to use the Juniper operating system (Junos). I was
                       given a device called a Juniper Firewall SRX-3OO. To put it simply, this device is a glorified
                       switch that is meant to act like a firewall and can be configured into a server. In addition, this
                       device differs from a traditional switch with its security policies. There are two ways to manage
                       this device. The traditional way is through the CLI (Junos). The practical way is through a web
                       interface referred to as J-Web. Both ways are similar in functionality and both possess the pros
                       and cons between working with a CLI and GUI. One thing to note is that Junos is a networking OS.
                       It reads from a config file that determines how it behaves. This config file is set from the
                       factory and can be edited by the user. Modifying this file is typically the source of work with this OS.<br />

                       <br />

                       <b>CLI Mode:</b><br />
                       There are 3 modes in Junos. The first mode is your typical UNIX command line which I have not done
                       much work in. If I learn a significant implementation that uses this mode, I will be sure to post about it in a later
                       blog post. The other 2 modes are operational, accessed using the <font style="font-family:'Courier New'">cli</font>
                       command, and configuration accessed using the <font style="font-family:'Courier New'">
                           configure
                       </font> command from operational mode. A lot of my work is done in
                       configuration mode. This is where we are editing the config file. A generic example of this config
                       file looks as follows:<br />

                       <br />

                       The config file is arranged in a hierarchy that is recursively traversed. To change or remove a value,
                       we use the <font style="font-family:'Courier New'">set</font> and <font style="font-family:'Courier New'">delete</font>
                       commands respectively. Respective examples include <font style="font-family:'Courier New'">set field subfield1 subfield2 value 2</font>
                       and <font style="font-family:'Courier New'">delete field subfield1 subfield2 value 2</font>. The commands are also
                       recursively parsed to check for syntax and whether a field exists in the config file. You can use the question mark (?)
                       character to see an option of available commands. Tab shortcuts also apply which you will need because the
                       hierarchical nature of the config file results in significantly long commands. You can also see the current
                       parameters set using the <font style="font-family:'Courier New'">show</font> command. Things that run in
                       operational mode will require <font style="font-family:'Courier New'">run show</font> in configuration mode
                       such as <font style="font-family:'Courier New'">dhcp-local-server statistics</font> for example. To see the
                       value 1 set in the example file, the command is <font style="font-family:'Courier New'">
                       show field subfield1 subfield2 value</font>. If this were an operational task, the
                       <font style="font-family:'Courier New'">run</font> command will need to be affixed. In operational mode however,
                       it is not needed. You can also change what heiarchy you are in to shorten your commands. For example, after entering
                       <font style="font-family:'Courier New'">edit field subfield1 subfield 2</font> you can simply enter the command
                       <font style="font-family:'Courier New'">set value 2</font> since you are in that hierarchy level. To go a level up, use
                       the <font style="font-family:'Courier New'">exit</font> command. In configure mode, after setting desired
                       parameters, the <font style="font-family:'Courier New'">commit</font> command is required for the configuration to
                       become operational. The <font style="font-family:'Courier New'">commit check</font> command checks to see whether the
                       configurations are valid without committing them. This mode is accessible via serial connection.<br/>

                       <br/>

                       <b>J-Web:</b><br/>
                       From here, you can simply edit the config file in edit mode without having to enter the commands.  A view mode is also available to
                       see the config file in read only mode. There are also specific features located in the interface that can be used to
                       configure a setting such as dhcp. Editing such settings automatically edits the config file. Committing then is made
                       with a press of a button. This mode is accessible via Ethernet connection with the default IP of 192.168.1.1 like most
                       routers. You must configure the IP address of the Ethernet port to a .1 network or .x for a 192.168.x.1 address. Here's a
                       video on using the J-Web interface:<br/>

                  During the 2018 Winter Triton Career fair, I had the opportunity to show 5 companies my
                  blog and get their approval on posting their responses to about their hiring process. I
                  hope the following information serves any help to any aspiring engineers. Good luck with
                  your job searches!<br/>
                  <br/>

                  <b>Question:</b> When looking for candidate employees to hire post interview, what do you
                  look for?<br/>

                  <br/>

                  <b>App Folio:</b> The primary thing I personally look for is the background technical
                  knowledge the applicant has in his/ her arsenal. This is the primary but not everything.
                  In other words, if this is lacking, it's most likely a rejection. The knowledge I'm 
                  talking about are CS fundamentals such as data structures and algorithms. The next thing
                  I look for are any projects they have done outside of school. This shows me that the
                  applicant is interested in what he/ she is doing and willing to take it outside the scope
                  of their schooling. School related major projects are good but outside of school is a 
                  plus. I'm not necessarily looking for any particular set of skills. Our framework is
                  written on Ruby on Rails and me myself never used this before I started working for App
                  Folio. However, one's background knowledge and experience outside of school shows me
                  their learning potential that they can contribute to the company. Lastly, I look for
                  individuals who are excellent problem solvers and more importantly, those who can
                  communicate effectively; get their point across accurately and clearly.<br/>

                  <br/>

                  <b>Stemonix:</b> As for technical skills, I look for one's ability to learn new technology
                  and specifically how well they can design. When it comes to education, those with a higher
                  level background are always preferred. But more importantly, I look for what they can
                  design and how good they are at what they do relative to their level education. I look for
                  critical thinkers, those who are efficient, and those who can learn fast given what their
                  technical background has to offer them. Even though higher levels of education are preferred,
                  I really care more about how they can harness what they have to offer. However, the more
                  important side is their attitude. I look up to individuals who have the character of a good
                  employee. This involves their punctuality, organization, work ethic, presentability, and
                  how well they can communicate. The technical side is moreover a tool to get the job done
                  but what really makes a good employee is HOW they work regardless of what technical
                  knowledge they have to offer.<br/>

                  <br/>

                  <b>Synopsys:</b> In university, technical background is extremely emphasized and if one can
                  get through the educational rigor their university has to offer without cheating, those are
                  means to an end. A weakness in this mindset is the lack of emphasis in one's soft skills. If
                  I can find a candidate who has excellent soft skills, they will stand out in the talent 
                  pool given the addition of the necessary background knowledge to perform their jobs. What I
                  look for is a candidate's ability to communicate effectively and firmly, work well with a
                  team, talk to strangers, offer good customer service, and present well. The technical skills
                  are only a means to an end however, it's the soft skills that will land one a job especially
                  in Silicon Valley. A good candidate would be memorable. This is one who can effectively argue
                  their points and still get along with a team, have good social skills, and be able to present
                  or lecture confidently with the ability to design good power points to back up those presentations.
                  Overall, it is the character that determines who will land the position. The technical background
                  is just a filter for those who have potential.<br/>

                  <br/>

                  <b>Aetna:</b> You need to be an excellent communicator. I cannot stress this enough. We get a lot
                  of applicants who have a lot of technical skills to show off but not enough people skills. When
                  it comes to technical skills, showing that one can use their technical background is a way for
                  one to sell themselves in their interview. However, I didn't know what I know now in terms of
                  technical skills before working at Aetna. The act of selling one's self, their ability to SHOW 
                  that they can perform the job given their technical background, that's a people skill. I like to 
                  see those who are aggressive yet approachable in addition to having the rudimentary technical
                  qualifications. While the technical qualifications are also a factor, the determining factor is one's
                  ability to communicate given their technical background.<br/>

                  <br/>

                  <b>Cubic:</b> Communication communication communication! This is what's very important aside of the
                  technical skills. Regardless of whether a candidate is technically qualified, what a good employee has
                  distinction in is their ability to communicate as they are working in order to be productive and
                  produce a favorable work environment. I love questions. One's ability to openly and urgently ask
                  questions shows their interest and urgency to solve their problems. At Cubic, there is only one stupid
                  question and that is the one that isn't asked. The three values I look for in a good applicant is their
                  urgency to produce good work, their openness to communicate, ask questions, and take initiative, and 
                  their ability to take ownership for their work and coming up with original and clever ways to do what 
                  needs to be done to meet a deadline. Anything technical can be learned on the job but good work is
                  presented in one who can communicate it, not necessarily  their technical background. The technical 
                  aspect is just the candidate's toolbox that can be expanded with good communication skills. It is also
                  important to note that what will also impress your interviewer is your knowledge on the software
                  development models since these concepts are heavily used in the industry. Technical skills will not
                  make one stand out as much as having the soft skills to back it up. The technical skills just get your
                  foot in the door.<br/>

                  <br/>
                  
                  From what I see, although technical skills are important, they are only a means of getting into the
                  hiring process. Typically, an applicant will have a vast set of skills but will not perfectly match
                  the set of skills the company needs. These skills however can be learned on the job and what determines
                  how well a candidate can learn these skills is not just their technical background, but the addition of
                  their work ethic displayed by how well they can communicate. There are several engineers out there with
                  distinct technical skills. What makes one memorable on top of their technical skills set is their 
                  ability to communicate effectively. It is an act of selling what one has to work with that can foreshadow 
                  how well they will work on a team given a qualified technical background.<br/>

                  This was my very first hackathon experience and quite an eventful one, much more than
                  what I expected. To start off, my impression of these events lies on one far end of
                  the spectrum of whether one can appreciate this event as being a rather eventful
                  challenge for highly aspiring engineers or feeling just about the opposite way
                  strongly. For me, I saw it as a challenge in terms of time and expected innovation,
                  and opportunity on the count of the networking chances and a vast array of hacks.
                  I definitely took advantage of the networking opportunities gaining insight from
                  multiple companies and exchanging ideas as well as offering my resume and professional 
                  online persona. I also took advantage of an API from Twilio in the hack that my team
                  came up with. From the networking opportunities to the handed challenge of coming up
                  with a hack that can become innovative, I also saw this experience as a convention for
                  many engineers to collaborate and exchange ideas from within a medium that everyone
                  can gain more knowledge from each other. Of course, the crown jewel of this event was
                  cranking out 2 all-nighters coming up with an innovative idea given ideas, hardware,
                  and even open source code provided by companies. I surely gained an idea, technical
                  skills, and stamina from this event. Best of all, my team won the grand prize for our
                  implementation of an IoT smart fridge.<br/>

                  What I am about to explain is a theory that is not necessarily accurate nor is it by any
                  means proven to be true. Capitalism, or some like to call it, a means of opportunity; as
                  implied by "opportunity", there are those that achieve it while there are as those who 
                  are exploited by it. A generic example to clarify this would be any competitive game, 
                  one that features a winner and a loser. That being said, capitalism has those whom are 
                  victorious and those who must work to make it up to victory. In a nutshell, to keep an economy 
                  that features free opportunity to socio-economic gain stable, there must be spenders in order to 
                  make capitalistic gain possible for the winners of the game. How does college play a role 
                  in this kind of society? It is actually more of an economic buffer than a provider of industrial
                  competencies. Generally, we only use 20% of what we learn in school as an application. After
                  13 years of school, one can only recall a handful of concepts but still competently live their
                  life. For example, out of math, the only means we use as an application are mathematical
                  operations. From science, we indirectly use the scientific method. We learn some language 
                  just enough to the point of useful communication. Specifically, as a CS student in college, one
                  can theoretically get by in the industry as a software engineer with a decent knowledge in some
                  programming languages, algorithms, and soft skills. Essentially, this can be achieved in a 
                  year rather than 4. One may argue that only those basic skills alone won't make one marketable. 
                  I will get to that later but theoretically, one can do the job of a software engineer with
                  those basic skills while the rest are only specific applications that one either happens to 
                  know or can be looked up whenever needed. Why do we spend all this time in school possessing 
                  a poor ratio of learned to applied concepts with what we study? One theory is economic 
                  stability. It is designed for a group of people, typically the younger ones, to be encouraged 
                  to spend money which will keep the economy moving and beneficial for those earning money. In 
                  capitalism, there must be spenders that gainers benefit from. This explains why society 
                  encourages an extended amount of time for the youth to be in school and is independent of 
                  whether these individuals can win in the capitalistic nature of the economy by being 
                  industrially qualified. In other words, a lot of the college degree is a rite of passage, 
                  the proof that one has spent their dues in school funds and is eligible for a role in the 
                  economy to finally make a good salary. To answer the argument that only knowing a limited 
                  amount of skills regardless of being applicable, will not make one a likely candidate for 
                  a job, this is an example of how the capitalistic economy urges one to spend money before 
                  landing a role in the economy that makes money. Although one's schooling and degree may have 
                  some significance in learning how to become industrially competent, that is only a limited 
                  part of it. The other part is maintaining economic stability by urging people to contribute 
                  money before being paid to contribute to society. Whether I completely agree with this 
                  theory is outside of my intentions of this blog post.<br/>

                  <br/>

                  The next thing I would like to discuss is an example that may assess this theory by 
                  explaining how my resume has evolved over time. To clarify, I will not be talking 
                  about how my resume got better in terms of its content moreover, I will be focusing 
                  on how my resume changed as I spent more tuition money to earn my right into a software 
                  engineering job. The point I would like to make is the increment in my social title 
                  suggested by my resume based on a quantity of dollars that I contributed to a capitalistic 
                  economy. Below are links to iterations of my resume tantamount to my time and money 
                  spent in education:<br/>

                  The trend I see here is that over time, I have been able to remove insignificant concepts
                  from my resume to make space for more relevant and larger scale experiences as I invest
                  more time and money towards my degree. Once again, I would like to thank Daniel Quinn
                  for this idea.

                  The study of computer science is defined by the scientific approach to answer
                  the problems of computation, the way that computers solve problems. Normally,
                  one would expect this degree to lead them to a software engineering career however,
                  the main take away I would like to point out is that software engineering is only
                  one out of many specific branches of computer science, one which is highly marketable 
                  in the industry. While one's expectation in a nutshell is that a CS degree leads to a
                  six-figure career, one must understand that this is not the case GENERALLY speaking
                  of the field of computer science. I will discuss from my experience what this field
                  of study actually is in a general sense rather than it being associated to a high
                  paying job. As I have noted earlier, computer science is a scientific mean of
                  computation. That is to say, the scientific method is actually used to solve the
                  problem of how to compute. Formerly, I misconstrued why this was considered science
                  but back then, my only experience at the time was coding, only one out of many aspects 
                  of computer science. When taking part in this field of study, one should expect three
                  main branches of computation. That is software, hardware, and theory. The most obvious
                  branch is software, anything that has to do with code and abstraction. This where I
                  felt I missed the understanding of this field being a science. Coding is more of an
                  application or toolbox to actively address a problem of computation. How does the code
                  actually work in a physical level? That brings me to the branch of hardware, particularly
                  digital design. This focuses on how to physically create the CPU to be programmed to solve
                  computable problems. This branch focuses on how to use signals on and off for a computer
                  to physically execute what the code tells it to do. How has all of this been figured out
                  to this day? This brings me to the theoretical branch of computer science. Every idea is
                  a theory until proven and put into practice. The theory branch is where most of the science
                  exists. It attempts to answer computation questions; what is solvable, how to solve it, and
                  how efficient it can be. A lot of algorithms and their efficiencies is studied in this
                  branch as well as a lot of hypothesis being tested. The theory of computation addresses
                  computing models to attempt to solve problems before the machine is built (hardware)
                  and code is given to it to put the solution into practice (software). All together, we
                  have the field of computer science.

               I have always had this burning question before I got into the industry. With CS being
               a rather abstract field of study, what does one actually do in the work force with all
               the abstract concepts in mind? First of all, I would like to make very clear that
               EVERYTHING one does in their course work is vital to their career. While some aspect
               in college may be directly or indirectly beneficial, every task is tied to each other
               and builds on itself. Any curriculum is built in its own unique way to educate aspiring
               engineers through time, addressing specific goals. To answer the question of what happens
               in the industry, expect projects as far as the eye can see to come under way, as well as
               the expectation of teamwork to accomplish large scale projects. Whether it is a basic
               application, some back-end database, or complicated network system, a CS degree's worth
               of skills to be used as one's toolbox is more than enough to answer an endless array
               of problems. To put it simply, college curriculums aim to allow engineers to grow
               overtime with the expectation that all information will be tied together in the end
               and can be recalled and utilized in some fashion to answer the consumer's need.
               College is all building, and practicing, with due dates simulating a consumer's 
               actual time of need for a product, and one's grade simulating how the consumer reacts 
               to one's work. Also, studying is acquiring  one's unique engineering toolbox while
               working is applying that toolbox to address a consumer's problem. However, what is
               physically done in school, one can expect it to be done in the industry as well.
