	          I have always had this burning question before I got into the industry. With CS being<br/>
		  a rather abstract field of study, what does one actually do in the work force with all<br/>
		  the abstract concepts in mind? First of all, I would like to make very clear that<br/>
		  EVERYTHING one does in their course work is vital to their career. While some aspect<br/>
		  in college may be directly or indirectly beneficial, every task is tied to each other<br/>
		  and builds on itself. Any curriculum is built in its own unique way to educate aspiring<br/>
		  engineers through time, addressing specific goals. To answer the question of what happens<br/>
		  in the industry, expect projects as far as the eye can see to come under way, as well as<br/>
		  the expectation of teamwork to accomplish large scale projects. Whether it is a basic<br/>
		  application, some back end database, or complicated network system, a CS degree's worth<br/>
		  of skills to be used as one's toolbox is more than enough to answer an endless array<br/>
		  of problems. To put it simply, college curriculums aim to allow engineers to grow<br/>
		  overtime with the expectation that all information will be tied together in the end<br/>
		  and can be recalled and utilized in some fashion to answer the consumer's need.<br/>
		  College is all building, and practicing, with due dates simulating a consumer's<br/> 
		  actual time of need for a product, and one's grade simulating how the consumer reacts<br/> 
		  to one's work. Also, studying is aquiring one's unique engineering toolbox while<br/>
		  working is applying that toolbox to address a consumer's problem. However, what is<br/>
		  physically done in school, one can expect it to be done in the industry as well.<br/>

               <center><font size="5px" style="color:blue">
                  The study of computer science is defined by the scientific approach to answer<br/>
                  the problems of computation, the way that computers solve problems. Normally,<br/>
                  one would expect this degree to lead them to a software engineering career however,</br>
                  the main take away I would like to point out is that software engineering is only<br/>
                  one out of many specific branches of computer science, one which is highly marketable<br/> 
                  in the industry. While one's expectation in a nutshell is that a CS degree leads to a<br/>
                  six figure career, one must understand that this is not the case GENERALLY speaking<br/>
                  of the field of computer science. I will discuss from my experience what this field<br/>
                  of study actually is in a general sense rather than it being associated to a high<br/>
                  paying job. As I have noted earlier, computer science is a scientific mean of<br/>
                  computation. That is to say, the scientific method is actually used to solve the<br/>
                  problem of how to compute. Formerly, I misconstrued why this was considered science<br/>
                  but then my only experience at the time was coding, only one out of many aspects of<br/> 
                  computer science. When taking part in this field of study, one should expect three<br/>
                  main branches of computation. That is software, hardware, and theory. The most obvious<br/>
                  branch is software, anything that has to do with code and abstraction. This where I<br/>
                  felt I missed the understanding of this field being a science. Coding is more of an<br/>
                  application or toolbox to actually address a problem of computation. How does the code<br/>
                  actually work in a physical level? That brings me to the branch of hardware, particularly<br/>
                  digital design. This focuses on how to physically create the CPU to be programmed to solve<br/>
                  computable problems. This branch focuses on how to use signals on and off for a computer<br/>
                  to physically execute what the code tells it to do. How has all of this been figured out<br/>
                  to this day? This brings me to the theoretical branch of computer science. Every idea is<br/>
                  a theory until proven and put into practice. The theory branch is where most of the science<br/>
                  exists. It attempts to answer computation questions, what is solvable, how to solve it, and<br/>
                  how efficient it can be. A lot of algorithms and their efficiencies is studied in this<br/>
                  branch.
