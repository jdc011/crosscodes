               I have always had this burning question before I got into the industry. With CS being
               a rather abstract field of study, what does one actually do in the work force with all
               the abstract concepts in mind? First of all, I would like to make very clear that
               EVERYTHING one does in their course work is vital to their career. While some aspect
               in college may be directly or indirectly beneficial, every task is tied to each other
               and builds on itself. Any curriculum is built in its own unique way to educate aspiring
               engineers through time, addressing specific goals. To answer the question of what happens
               in the industry, expect projects as far as the eye can see to come under way, as well as
               the expectation of teamwork to accomplish large scale projects. Whether it is a basic
               application, some back end database, or complicated network system, a CS degree's worth
               of skills to be used as one's toolbox is more than enough to answer an endless array
               of problems. To put it simply, college curriculums aim to allow engineers to grow
               overtime with the expectation that all information will be tied together in the end
               and can be recalled and utilized in some fashion to answer the consumer's need.
               College is all building, and practicing, with due dates simulating a consumer's 
               actual time of need for a product, and one's grade simulating how the consumer reacts 
               to one's work. Also, studying is aquiring one's unique engineering toolbox while
               working is applying that toolbox to address a consumer's problem. However, what is
               physically done in school, one can expect it to be done in the industry as well.

                  The study of computer science is defined by the scientific approach to answer
                  the problems of computation, the way that computers solve problems. Normally,
                  one would expect this degree to lead them to a software engineering career however,
                  the main take away I would like to point out is that software engineering is only
                  one out of many specific branches of computer science, one which is highly marketable 
                  in the industry. While one's expectation in a nutshell is that a CS degree leads to a
                  six figure career, one must understand that this is not the case GENERALLY speaking
                  of the field of computer science. I will discuss from my experience what this field
                  of study actually is in a general sense rather than it being associated to a high
                  paying job. As I have noted earlier, computer science is a scientific mean of
                  computation. That is to say, the scientific method is actually used to solve the
                  problem of how to compute. Formerly, I misconstrued why this was considered science
                  but back then, my only experience at the time was coding, only one out of many aspects 
                  of computer science. When taking part in this field of study, one should expect three
                  main branches of computation. That is software, hardware, and theory. The most obvious
                  branch is software, anything that has to do with code and abstraction. This where I
                  felt I missed the understanding of this field being a science. Coding is more of an
                  application or toolbox to actively address a problem of computation. How does the code
                  actually work in a physical level? That brings me to the branch of hardware, particularly
                  digital design. This focuses on how to physically create the CPU to be programmed to solve
                  computable problems. This branch focuses on how to use signals on and off for a computer
                  to physically execute what the code tells it to do. How has all of this been figured out
                  to this day? This brings me to the theoretical branch of computer science. Every idea is
                  a theory until proven and put into practice. The theory branch is where most of the science
                  exists. It attempts to answer computation questions; what is solvable, how to solve it, and
                  how efficient it can be. A lot of algorithms and their efficiencies is studied in this
                  branch as well as a lot of hypothesis being tested. The theory of computation addresses
                  computing models to attempt to solve problems before the machine is built (hardware)
                  and code is given to it to put the solution into practice (software). All together, we
                  have the field of computer science.

                  What I am about to explain is a theory that is not necessarily accurate nor is it by any
                  means proven to be true. Capitalism, or some like to call it, a means of opportunity; as
                  implied by "opportunity", there are those that achieve it while there are as those who 
                  are exploited by it. A generic example to clarify this would be any competative game, 
                  one that features a winner and a loser. That being said, capitalism has those whom are 
                  victorious and those who must work to make it up to victory. In a nutshell, to keep an economy 
                  that features free opportunity to socio-economic gain stable, there must be spenders in order to 
                  make capitalistic gain possible for the winners of the game. How does college play a role 
                  in this kind of society? It is actually more of an economic buffer than a provider of industrial
                  competencies. Generally, we only use 20% of what we learn in school as an application. After
                  13 years of school, one can only recall a handful of concepts but still competently live their
                  life. For example, out of math, the only means we use as an application are mathematical
                  oprations. From science, we indirectly use the scientific method. We learn some language 
                  just enough to the point of useful communication. Specifically as a CS student in college, one
                  can theoretically get by in the industry as a software engineer with a decent knoledge in some
                  programming languages, algorithms, and soft skills. Essentially, this can be achieved in a 
                  year rather than 4. One may argue that only those basic skills alone won't make one marketable. 
                  I will get to that later but theoretically, one can do the job of a software engineer with
                  those basic skills while the rest are only specific applications that one either happens to 
                  know, or can be looked up whenever needed. Why do we spend all this time in school possesing 
                  a poor ratio of learned to applied concepts with what we study? One theory is economic 
                  stability. It is designed for a group of people, typically the younger ones, to be encouraged 
                  to spend money which will keep the economy moving and beneficial for those earning money. In 
                  capitalism, there must be spenders that gainers benefit from. This explains why society 
                  encourages an extended amount of time for the youth to be in school and is independent of 
                  whether these individuals can win in the capitalistic nature of the economy by being 
                  industrially qualified. In other words, a lot of the college degree is a rite of passage, 
                  the proof that one has spent their dues in school funds and is elligible for a role in the 
                  economy to finally make a good salary. To answer the argument that only knowing a limited 
                  amount of skills regardless of being applicable, will not make one a likely candidate for 
                  a job, this is an example of how the capitalistic economy urges one to spend money before 
                  landing a role in the economy that makes money. Although one's schooling and degree may have 
                  some significance in learning how to become industrially competent, that is only a limited 
                  part of it. The other part is maintaining economic stability by urging people to contribute 
                  money before being paid to contribute to society. Whether I completely agree with this 
                  theory is outside of my intentions of this blog post.<br/>

                  <br/>

                  The next thing I would like to discuss is an example that may assess this thoery by 
                  explaining how my resume has evolved over time. To clarify, I will not be talking 
                  about how my resume got better in terms of its content moreover, I will be focusing 
                  on how my resume changed as I spent more tuition money to earn my right into a software 
                  engineering job. The point I would like to make is the increment in my social title 
                  suggested by my resume based on a quantity of dollars that I contributed to a capitalistic 
                  economy. Below are links to iterations of my resume tantamount to my time and money 
                  spent in education:<br/>

                  The trend I see here is that over time, I have been able to remove insignificant concepts
                  from my resume to make space for more relavant and larger scale experiences as I invest
                  more time and money towards my degree. Once again, I would like to thank Daniel Quinn
                  for this idea.

                  This was my very first hackathon experience and quite an eventful one, much more than
                  what I expected. To start off, my impression of these events lies on one far end of
                  the spectrum of whether one can appreciate this event as being a rather eventful
                  challenge for highly aspiring engineers, or feeling just about the opposite way
                  strongly. For me, I saw it as a challenge in terms of time and expected innovation,
                  and opportunity on the count of the networking chances and a vast array of hacks.
                  I definitely took advantage of the networking opportunities gaining insight from
                  multiple companies and exchanging ideas as well as offering my resume and prefossional
                  online persona. I also took advantage of an API from Twilio in the hack that my team
                  came up with. From the networking opportunities to the handed challenge of coming up
                  with a hack that can become innovative, I also saw this experience as a convention for
                  many engineers to collaborate and exchange ideas from within a medium that everyone
                  can gain more knowledge from each other. Ofcourse, the crown jewel of this event was
                  cranking out 2 all nighters coming up with an innovative idea given ideas, hardware,
                  and even open source code provided by companies. I surely gained an idea, technical
                  skills, and stamina from this event. Best of all, my team won the grand prize for our
                  implementation of an IoT smart fridge.<br/>

                  During the 2018 Winter Triton Career fair, I had the opportunity to show 4 companies my
                  blog and get their approval on posting their responses to about their hiring process. I
                  hope the following information serves any help to any aspiring engineers. Good luck with
                  your job searches!<br/>
                  <br/>

                  <b>Question:</b> When looking for candidate employees to hire post interview, what do you
                  look for?<br/>

                  <br/>

                  <b>App Folio:</b> The primary thing I personally look for is the background technical
                  knowledge the applicant has in his/ her arsenal. This is the primary but not everything.
                  In other words, if this is lacking, it's most likely a rejection. The knowledge I'm 
                  talking about are CS fundamentals such as data structures and algorithms. The next thing
                  I look for are any projects they have done outside of school. This shows me that the
                  applicant is interested in what he/ she is doing and willing to take it outside the scope
                  of their schooling. School related major projects are good but outside of school is a 
                  plus. I'm not necesserily looking for any particular set of skills. Our framework is
                  written on Ruby on Rails and I myself never used this before I started working for App
                  Folio. However, one's background knowledge and experience outside of school shows me
                  their learning potential that they can contribute to the company. Lastly, I look for
                  individuals who are excellent problem solvers and more importantly, those who can
                  communicate effectively; get their point across accurately and clearly.<br/>

                  <br/>

                  <b>Stemonix:</b> As for technical skills, I look for one's ability to learn new technology
                  and specifically how well they can design. When it comes to education, those with a higher
                  level bakground are always preferred. But more importantly, I look for what they can
                  design and how good they are are what they do relative to their level education. I look for
                  critical thinkers, those who are efficient, and those who can learn fast given what their
                  technical background has to offer them. Even though higher levels of education is preferred,
                  I really care more about how they can harness what they have to offer. However, the more
                  important side is their attitude. I look up to individuals who have the character of a good
                  employee. This involves their punctuality, organization, work ethic, presentability, and
                  how well they can communicate. The technical side is moreover a tool to get the job done
                  but what really makes a good employee is how they work regardless of what technical
                  knowledge they have to offer.<br/>

                  <br/>

                  <b>Synopsys:</b> In university, technical background is extremely emphasized and if one can
                  get through the educational rigor their university has to offer without cheating, those are
                  means to an end. A weakness in this mindset is the lack of emphasis in one's soft skills. If
                  I can find a candidate who has excellent soft skills, they will stand out in the talent 
                  pool given the addition of the necessary background knowledge to perform their jobs. What I
                  look for is a candidate's ability to communicate effectively and firmly, work well with a
                  team, talk to strangers, offer good customer service, and present well. The technical skills
                  are only a means to an end however, it's the soft skills that will land one a job especially
                  in Silicon Valley. A good candidate would be memorable. This is one who can effectively argue
                  their points and still get along with a team, have good social skills, and be able to present
                  or lecture confidently with the ability to design good power points to back up those presentations.
                  Overall, it is the character that determines who will land the position. The technical background
                  is just a filter for those who have potential.<br/>

                  <br/>

                  <b>Aetna:</b> You need to be an excellent communicator. I cannot stress this enough. We get a lot
                  of applicants who have a lot of technical skills to show off but not enough people skills. When
                  it comes to technical skills, showing that one can use their technical background is a way for
                  one to sell themselves in their interview. However, I didn't know what I know now in terms of
                  technical skills before working at Aetna. The act of selling one's self, their ability to SHOW 
                  that they can perform the job given their technical background, that's a people skill. I like to 
                  see those who are aggresive yet approachable in addition to having the rudamentary technical
                  qualifications. While the technical qualifications are also a factor, the determining factor is one's
                  ability to communicate given their technical background.<br/>

                  <br/>

                  <b>Cubic:</b> Communication communication communication! This is what's very important aside of the
                  technical skills. Regardless of whether a candidate is technically qualified, what a good employee has
                  distinction in is their ability to communicate as they are working in order to be productive and
                  produce a favorable work environment. I love questions. One's ability to openly and urgently ask
                  questions shows their interest and urgency to solve their problems. At Cubic, there is only one stupid
                  question and that is the one that isn't asked. The three values I look for in a good applicant is their
                  urgency to produce good work, their openness to communicate, ask questions, and take initiative, and 
                  their ability to take ownership for their work and coming up with original and clever ways to do what 
                  needs to be done to meet a deadline. Anything technical can be learned on the job but good work is
                  presented in one who can communicate it, not necesserily their technical background. The technical 
                  aspect is just the candidate's toolbox that can be expanded with good communication skills. It is also
                  important to note that what will also impress your interviewer is your knowledge on the software
                  development models since these concepts are heavily used in the industry. Technical skills will not
                  make one stand out as much as having the soft skills to back it up. The technical skills just gets your
                  foot in the door.<br/>

                  <br/>
                  
                  From what I see, although technical skills are important, they are only a means of getting into the
                  hiring process. Typically, an applicant will have a vast set of skills but will not perfectly match
                  the set of skills the company needs. These skills however can be learned on the job and what determines
                  how well a candidate can learn these skills is not just their technical background, but the addition of
                  their work ethic displayed by how well they can communicate. There are several engineers out their with
                  distinct technical skills. What makes one memberable on top of their technical skills set is their 
                  ability to communicate effectively. It is an act of selling what one has to work with that can forshadow
                  how well they will work on a team given a qualified technical background.<br/>
