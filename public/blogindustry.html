                   We have all gone through the insatiably repetitive task of updating and proof reading our resumes
                   in order to maximize the quality of how we sell ourselves to the industry. Before I go into the few 
                   tips I'd like to share about writing resumes, I would like to mention a few principles to consider
                   regarding resumes. First off, your resume is your marketing tool therefore, it is vital that it
                   goes through substantial edits and feedback from multiple eyes. Everyone has different ideas for
                   what makes a resume good but the ideas that matter are those who have the recruiting power. Thus, the more people
                   you can get to review your resume, the more information you have on marketing yourself optimally
                   to the perspective of others. Another point to mention is that a recruiter will spend an average
                   of 5-10 seconds looking at your resume so plan accordingly to best communicate your experience
                   and format in a quick read friendly way. Now to discuss some tips on writing your resume:
                   <br/><br/>
                   - adopt a mindset that you can never write the perfect resume and be prepared to take constructive
                   criticism; the more flexible you are, the better ability you have in writing a good resume<br/>
                   - NO MORE than one page; if it's over a page, it's a CV so make it work<br/>
                   - avoid having a high concentrated area of text in order to make your resume more desirable to read
                   within a few seconds<br/>
                   - it helps to bold keywords<br/>
                   - numerical metrics look good (ie. "design saved 45 watts of power"; "cut costs by 14%"")<br/>
                   - conserve space; you only have a page (only put job relevant information that can actually help your chances of getting hired)<br/>
                   - objectives/ summaries are a waste of space; whatever job you apply for, the recruiter already knows your objective which
                   is obviously to land that job so just get to the point with your skills and experience<br/>
                   - school projects are frowned upon but if you have no other experience, strive to explain your project in a way that
                   APPLIES relevant skills (ie. "implemented autocomplete algorithm for user generated text" rather than "programmed multiway trie")<br/>
                   - go out of your way to do projects; there's plenty of tutorials online that can apply and sharpen your skills<br/>
                   - use "achiever" rather than "doer" statements for your descriptions (ie. "proposed agreement with payroll contractors 
                   slashing labor costs by 10%" rather than "negotiated with payroll contractors")<br/>
                   - send text versions of your resume; there's a good chance that the selection process is computerized and based on
                   keyterms present in resumes; see how your resume looks using <a href="https://pdftotext.com/" target="_blank">ATS</a> (Applicant Tracking System)<br/>
                   - hyperlinks look good for showing proof of your projects but keep the format (don't use hyperlink default format)<br/>
                   - anything you write on your resume is fair game for interview questions so STUDY; the point of your resume is to land 
                   the interview, once that is accomplished, the next step is making sure you are prepared to talk about everything in your resume<br/>
                   - keep resume up-to-date; in the unfortunate event you are unemployed for an extended period, do projects and put them in your resume<br/>

                  During the 2018 Winter Triton Career fair, I had the opportunity to show 5 companies my
                  blog and get their approval on posting their responses to about their hiring process. I
                  hope the following information serves any help to any aspiring engineers. Good luck with
                  your job searches!<br/>
                  <br/>

                  <b>Question:</b> When looking for candidate employees to hire post interview, what do you
                  look for?<br/>

                  <br/>

                  <b>App Folio:</b> The primary thing I personally look for is the background technical
                  knowledge the applicant has in his/ her arsenal. This is the primary but not everything.
                  In other words, if this is lacking, it's most likely a rejection. The knowledge I'm 
                  talking about are CS fundamentals such as data structures and algorithms. The next thing
                  I look for are any projects they have done outside of school. This shows me that the
                  applicant is interested in what he/ she is doing and willing to take it outside the scope
                  of their schooling. School related major projects are good but outside of school is a 
                  plus. I'm not necessarily looking for any particular set of skills. Our framework is
                  written on Ruby on Rails and me myself never used this before I started working for App
                  Folio. However, one's background knowledge and experience outside of school shows me
                  their learning potential that they can contribute to the company. Lastly, I look for
                  individuals who are excellent problem solvers and more importantly, those who can
                  communicate effectively; get their point across accurately and clearly.<br/>

                  <br/>

                  <b>Stemonix:</b> As for technical skills, I look for one's ability to learn new technology
                  and specifically how well they can design. When it comes to education, those with a higher
                  level background are always preferred. But more importantly, I look for what they can
                  design and how good they are at what they do relative to their level education. I look for
                  critical thinkers, those who are efficient, and those who can learn fast given what their
                  technical background has to offer them. Even though higher levels of education are preferred,
                  I really care more about how they can harness what they have to offer. However, the more
                  important side is their attitude. I look up to individuals who have the character of a good
                  employee. This involves their punctuality, organization, work ethic, presentability, and
                  how well they can communicate. The technical side is moreover a tool to get the job done
                  but what really makes a good employee is HOW they work regardless of what technical
                  knowledge they have to offer.<br/>

                  <br/>

                  <b>Synopsys:</b> In university, technical background is extremely emphasized and if one can
                  get through the educational rigor their university has to offer without cheating, those are
                  means to an end. A weakness in this mindset is the lack of emphasis in one's soft skills. If
                  I can find a candidate who has excellent soft skills, they will stand out in the talent 
                  pool given the addition of the necessary background knowledge to perform their jobs. What I
                  look for is a candidate's ability to communicate effectively and firmly, work well with a
                  team, talk to strangers, offer good customer service, and present well. The technical skills
                  are only a means to an end however, it's the soft skills that will land one a job especially
                  in Silicon Valley. A good candidate would be memorable. This is one who can effectively argue
                  their points and still get along with a team, have good social skills, and be able to present
                  or lecture confidently with the ability to design good power points to back up those presentations.
                  Overall, it is the character that determines who will land the position. The technical background
                  is just a filter for those who have potential.<br/>

                  <br/>

                  <b>Aetna:</b> You need to be an excellent communicator. I cannot stress this enough. We get a lot
                  of applicants who have a lot of technical skills to show off but not enough people skills. When
                  it comes to technical skills, showing that one can use their technical background is a way for
                  one to sell themselves in their interview. However, I didn't know what I know now in terms of
                  technical skills before working at Aetna. The act of selling one's self, their ability to SHOW 
                  that they can perform the job given their technical background, that's a people skill. I like to 
                  see those who are aggressive yet approachable in addition to having the rudimentary technical
                  qualifications. While the technical qualifications are also a factor, the determining factor is one's
                  ability to communicate given their technical background.<br/>

                  <br/>

                  <b>Cubic:</b> Communication communication communication! This is what's very important aside of the
                  technical skills. Regardless of whether a candidate is technically qualified, what a good employee has
                  distinction in is their ability to communicate as they are working in order to be productive and
                  produce a favorable work environment. I love questions. One's ability to openly and urgently ask
                  questions shows their interest and urgency to solve their problems. At Cubic, there is only one stupid
                  question and that is the one that isn't asked. The three values I look for in a good applicant is their
                  urgency to produce good work, their openness to communicate, ask questions, and take initiative, and 
                  their ability to take ownership for their work and coming up with original and clever ways to do what 
                  needs to be done to meet a deadline. Anything technical can be learned on the job but good work is
                  presented in one who can communicate it, not necessarily  their technical background. The technical 
                  aspect is just the candidate's toolbox that can be expanded with good communication skills. It is also
                  important to note that what will also impress your interviewer is your knowledge on the software
                  development models since these concepts are heavily used in the industry. Technical skills will not
                  make one stand out as much as having the soft skills to back it up. The technical skills just get your
                  foot in the door.<br/>

                  <br/>
                  
                  From what I see, although technical skills are important, they are only a means of getting into the
                  hiring process. Typically, an applicant will have a vast set of skills but will not perfectly match
                  the set of skills the company needs. These skills however can be learned on the job and what determines
                  how well a candidate can learn these skills is not just their technical background, but the addition of
                  their work ethic displayed by how well they can communicate. There are several engineers out there with
                  distinct technical skills. What makes one memorable on top of their technical skills set is their 
                  ability to communicate effectively. It is an act of selling what one has to work with that can foreshadow 
                  how well they will work on a team given a qualified technical background.<br/>

                  What I am about to explain is a theory that is not necessarily accurate nor is it by any
                  means proven to be true. Capitalism, or some like to call it, a means of opportunity; as
                  implied by "opportunity", there are those that achieve it while there are as those who 
                  are exploited by it. A generic example to clarify this would be any competitive game, 
                  one that features a winner and a loser. That being said, capitalism has those whom are 
                  victorious and those who must work to make it up to victory. In a nutshell, to keep an economy 
                  that features free opportunity to socio-economic gain stable, there must be spenders in order to 
                  make capitalistic gain possible for the winners of the game. How does college play a role 
                  in this kind of society? It is actually more of an economic buffer than a provider of industrial
                  competencies. Generally, we only use 20% of what we learn in school as an application. After
                  13 years of school, one can only recall a handful of concepts but still competently live their
                  life. For example, out of math, the only means we use as an application are mathematical
                  operations. From science, we indirectly use the scientific method. We learn some language 
                  just enough to the point of useful communication. Specifically, as a CS student in college, one
                  can theoretically get by in the industry as a software engineer with a decent knowledge in some
                  programming languages, algorithms, and soft skills. Essentially, this can be achieved in a 
                  year rather than 4. One may argue that only those basic skills alone won't make one marketable. 
                  I will get to that later but theoretically, one can do the job of a software engineer with
                  those basic skills while the rest are only specific applications that one either happens to 
                  know or can be looked up whenever needed. Why do we spend all this time in school possessing 
                  a poor ratio of learned to applied concepts with what we study? One theory is economic 
                  stability. It is designed for a group of people, typically the younger ones, to be encouraged 
                  to spend money which will keep the economy moving and beneficial for those earning money. In 
                  capitalism, there must be spenders that gainers benefit from. This explains why society 
                  encourages an extended amount of time for the youth to be in school and is independent of 
                  whether these individuals can win in the capitalistic nature of the economy by being 
                  industrially qualified. In other words, a lot of the college degree is a rite of passage, 
                  the proof that one has spent their dues in school funds and is eligible for a role in the 
                  economy to finally make a good salary. To answer the argument that only knowing a limited 
                  amount of skills regardless of being applicable, will not make one a likely candidate for 
                  a job, this is an example of how the capitalistic economy urges one to spend money before 
                  landing a role in the economy that makes money. Although one's schooling and degree may have 
                  some significance in learning how to become industrially competent, that is only a limited 
                  part of it. The other part is maintaining economic stability by urging people to contribute 
                  money before being paid to contribute to society. Whether I completely agree with this 
                  theory is outside of my intentions of this blog post.<br/>

                  <br/>

                  The next thing I would like to discuss is an example that may assess this theory by 
                  explaining how my resume has evolved over time. To clarify, I will not be talking 
                  about how my resume got better in terms of its content moreover, I will be focusing 
                  on how my resume changed as I spent more tuition money to earn my right into a software 
                  engineering job. The point I would like to make is the increment in my social title 
                  suggested by my resume based on a quantity of dollars that I contributed to a capitalistic 
                  economy. Below are links to iterations of my resume tantamount to my time and money 
                  spent in education:<br/>

                  <br/>

                  The trend I see here is that over time, I have been able to remove insignificant concepts
                  from my resume to make space for more relevant and larger scale experiences as I invest
                  more time and money towards my degree. Once again, I would like to thank Daniel Quinn
                  for this idea.
