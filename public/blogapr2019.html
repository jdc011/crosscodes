                  One of my coworkers, also a backend developer, asked for my assistance in addressing a UI bug resulting from cross-site scripting.
                  The first thing to address was the fact that there was no guard against cross-site scripting for the text field. This resulted
                  into an HTML parse error whenever a user inputs "&lt;/script&gt;" and returns. The first thing I wanted to do was address the
                  error that seems to be XSS related before moving on to what was planned as a UI bug fix task. However, the UI bug turned out to be the
                  direct result of the parse error. JSON data would be displayed in the interface from a user input of "&lt;/script&gt;". What was
                  happening was user-inputted data would be generated into raw HTML via the call 
                  <font style="font-family:'Courier New'">@Html.Raw(Newtonsoft.Json.JsonConvert.SerializeObject(Model))</font>. An unintended consequence would result from the text "&lt;/script&gt;"
                  getting generated as raw HTML where the browser would interpret the text as a terminating script tag. As a result, the browser 
                  would interpret everything after the generated script tag as literal elements due to the parse error. Right after the 
                  script tag within the area where raw HTML gets generated, there is generated JSON data intended to be parsed but is output instead.<br/><br/>

                  4. Make sure that all user inputs that will be generated to raw HTML are properly encoded.

                  I was in a meeting about a development practice known as "mob programming", a concept proposed to be incorporated in my company's development
                  process. The main idea is to have a group of typically 4 - 5 developers (sweet spot) each alternating between who will be behind the 
                  computer actively writing code while the rest of the developers in the group are watching and communicating
                  suggestions. The one coding is referred to as the driver while those behind the driver are referred to as the navigators. The navigators 
                  are all responsible for guiding the driver. This method of software development requires everyone's watches to be strictly in sync
                  (ie. no coding after 5pm). This addresses the problems of bugs resulting from late check ins. Typically the driver gets 15 minutes
                  behind the keyboard to actively code. Due to this limited amount of time, coming up with ideas is the responsibility of the navigators, 
                  not the driver. This time synchronized and divided responsibility of labor is meant to maximize efficiency. In order to accomplish this, 
                  psychological safety would need to be emphasized as a significant factor in successful development.<br/><br/>

                  At work, I was tasked with adding security enhancements to the resume upload feature on 
                  <a href="http://www.ashcompanies.com" target="_blank">ASHCompanies</a>. Part of the additional features I was asked to implement involved
                  verifying that the file signature matched with the file extension on the filename of the uploaded resume. To accomplish this, the first idea
                  that came to my mind was using a stream object to read the bytes of the file, save the read contents to a variable, then use
                  that variable for validation. Reading the file contents was where the fiasco began. It turned out that reading the file 
                  contents through a stream was actually removing the specific bytes read thus corrupting the uploaded resumes. QA only tested
                  the security features assuming that the uploaded resumes would be unchanged. Once deployed to production, it only took 24 hours
                  for HR to notice this issue.<br/><br/>
                  Looking into the code, I noticed the files being uploaded via <font style="font-family:'Courier New'">
                  <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.web.httppostedfilebase?view=netframework-4.8" target="_blank">HTTPPostedFileBase</a></font>.
                  This is a .NET class used to upload files to a server by transferring the bytes through the HTTP protocol. I verified that
                  the specific bytes I'm reading to verify the file signature (only the first 4 bytes) were the only bytes being erased from the uploaded
                  file. The fix was to reset the file stream position. This is typically not required for regular file stream objects but I'm
                  guessing this is different for the <font style="font-family:'Courier New'">HTTPPostedFileBase</font> class. Since the file
                  bytes are being transferred over a network, having a stream read over specific bytes seems to cause failure of said bytes to  
                  be successfully uploaded unless the stream position is explicitly set back to the position of which bytes are expected to
                  make it through the upload. We want all of the bytes so this meant setting the file stream position to 0.<br/><br/>
                  <font style="font-family:'Courier New'">HTTPPostedFileBase</font> contains an <font style="font-family:'Courier New'">InputStream</font>
                  object. The fix is done by the explicit initialization 
                  <font style="font-family:'Courier New'">HTTPPostedFileBase_reference.InputStream.Position = 0;</font> after reading. Also, it is important to
                  avoid the <font style="font-family:'Courier New'">HTTPPostedFileBase_reference.InputStream.Close()</font> call before setting the
                  position to 0.

                  At work, I ran into a code block that looked like the following:<br/>

                  if some_condition do<br/>

                  </font>
                  <br/>
                  I thought this looked peculiar so I mentioned it on Slack. One of my coworkers gladly addressed my confusion. The reason for this
                  code style is related to debugging. The if statement was checking whether the application is running locally, or on a network able
                  to send email. If it ran locally, it would generate a text file of the email that would normally be sent and save it to a folder.
                  The idea is to comment out the correct function call depending on whether the application is running locally or on a network. As a 
                  college student, I was overtaught my commenting habbits. It seems trivial and ideal to write in a high level exactly what the code 
                  is doing. However, this
                  can become micromanagement at times; having to write file/ function headers and inline comments. It seems subjective around
                  software development teams however, commenting too much is possible and never optimal. I asked my coworker if it would be ideal to 
                  comment the purpose of this code block to prevent confusion when someone else works on it in the future. He advised against it for a
                  couple reasons. First off, development is constantly changing the code's structure possibly rendering any comments related to the
                  current scenario to eventually be outdated. Second, the functions are named after exactly what they do. This eliminates the need for
                  function headers above functions, and inline comments where the functions are called. Overall, even though commenting one's code is 
                  important, it's not always the answer. This is an example of where it's not but instead, it's overkill. It is possible to reduce the 
                  amount of labor and still maintain code cleanliness by following best practices when naming functions. This removes excess need to 
                  comment, especially in cases such as this where the effort and possible lack of future relevance in commenting outweighs the need to 
                  document a code block.
