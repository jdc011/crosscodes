                   Looking for a job? Trying to get your career started? Looking to expand your network, learn about new opportunities, or
                   to get to know more companies that are looking for you? Attending a career fair is a great way to address any of the above
                   desires. To get the most out of your career fair experience, here are 9 tips that have been explained by those who run
                   the quarterly Triton Career Fair at UCSD:<br/><br/>
                   <b>1. Have healthy expectations</b><br/>
                   Don't expect that you will be successful with whatever top tech company is your top
                   choice. Also understand that the more competitive companies will have longer lines that can have you waiting for over an
                   hour. You should ask yourself if it's worth it to invest all that time waiting in line for one company rather than
                   exploring around. In general, don't put all your eggs in one basket. You want to expand your options. The point of
                   attending a career fair is to expand your employment opportunities in addition to meeting with employers face to face
                   and expanding your network. Also, understand that attending career fairs does not necessarily give you a higher probability
                   of landing a job over mass applying online. The advantage is mainly networking and educating yourself about open
                   opportunities.<br/><br/>
                   <b>2. Bring several copies of your updated resume</b><br/>
                   It is better to have too much than too little copies of your physical resume. The last thing you want is to run out of copies
                   with the presence of potential employers you have yet to talk to. I normally bring at least 20 copies.<br/><br/>
                   <b>3. Do your research on the companies attending</b><br/>
                   Want to know about companies you are aiming to work for? Do your research on the given list of companies attending. 
                   This also lets employers know that you are
                   interested in them by taking the time to learn about their companies as well as give you something to talk about. When
                   researching, it is best to start at their website. Look for the essentials; their mission statement, what they do, and who they
                   serve. Read up on some articles to expand your research and/ or find a Wiki page or blog about them to expand your knowledge.
                   Try to find out their technical background and process if you can as well as any soft skills and principles they value. After 
                   you learned a thing or two, figure out how you can positively impact their company with the skill set you have to offer by
                   looking for ties in your resume and their expectations. It also helps to apply online beforehand.<br/><br/>
                   <b>4. Rank employers you want to meet</b><br/>
                   It is good practice to keep a spreadsheet ranking the companies you want to meet. Do your research and prioritize what you are
                   personally looking for. This can include culture, type of work, company perks, benefits, salary, location, etc. Ask yourself
                   where you would want to work and why. Obviously don't actually talk about benefits. You are not yet in the position to be
                   negotiating your compensation when talking to the employers. Also be sure to factor in the expected amount of time you will
                   be in line for a company.<br/><br/>
                   <b>5. Practice your elevator pitch</b><br/>
                   Usually, employers will ask you to tell them a little about yourself. Being confident shows good character and helps the
                   employers remember you later. This confidence comes with practice. Come up with an outline of your technical background,
                   what you are looking for, and how you can contribute, and rehearse it. Learn to communicate it effectively and confidently
                   but be humble. Practice your flow. It doesn't take that much time to practice a 30-45 second elevator pitch.<br/><br/>
                   <b>6. Manage your time wisely</b><br/>
                   Make sure you can meet as much of your higher prioritized companies. Show up as early as possible to get as much time as
                   you need. Some lines take over an hour of waiting. Ask yourself whether it's worth it to wait that long. A long wait can be
                   time wasted that could've been spent talking to other companies. Also, don't spend too much time talking to one company. Be
                   brief in explaining your highlights. Remember that employers are trying to give everyone an equal chance to talk to them. Also,
                   taking too long with a employer can have negative consequences. They may not appreciate you taking a significant chunk of their
                   time in addition to wasting your own time.<br/><br/>
                   <b>7. Dress for success</b><br/>
                   The dress doesn't make the person but if you can, do it. I gives the employer a sense of respectability of your character
                   knowing that you took the time to dress well to talk to them.<br/><br/>
                   <b>8. Ask for contact information and follow up along with a "thank you"</b><br/>
                   Increase your chances of getting an interview and the employers remembering you by asking for business cards and contact information
                   with intention to follow up a week later. Be sure to mention anything significant from the past conversation that can help you land 
                   an interview. Also, thank them for their time. It shows that you are respectable.<br/><br/>
                   <b>9. Be prepared</b><br/>
                   Have a folder handy to hold your resumes, a pen to write with (having a pen ready makes a good impression), and some paper to take
                   important notes. Having a tablet at hand is a plus if you can use it to show the employers relevant work, perhaps your online portfolio
                   if you have one.<br/><br/>
                   Overall, be courteous, be professional, be prepared, and be humble. Make sure you are there for the right reasons.

                   This blog post is an extension of <a href="blog_2.html#13">Resume tips</a> if you have not read up on that post yet. I attended
                   a career fair prep event where I got my resume critiqued thanks to <a href="https://act.ucsd.edu/directory/search?search-scope=directory&entry=melissa+hoon&site=career" target="_blank">
                   Melissa Hoon</a>, a UCSD Career Center staff member. In addition to my previous post on Resumes, here are some more tips from her:<br/><br/>
                   - include objective with buzz words (specific type of job you're looking for + location; be brief (1 - 2 phrases), enthusiastic, and state the skills you have to offer)<br/>
                   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This contradicts my previous post.<br/> 
                   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Objectives make it clear what job<br/> 
                   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you're looking for and serve as a<br/>
                   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; small elevator pitch to sell yourself.<br/>
                   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, there's no need to go<br/>
                   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; overboard. Conserve space for the rest<br/>
                   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of your content.<br/>
                   - make room for the content that sells you (expand margins; limit spaces and font sizes; use columns, footers, headers; etc. make it work on one page)<br/>
                   - communicate effectively (make your content state the impact you made rather than it being task based)<br/>
                   - descriptions typically start with verbs (actions) and are structured as (action making impact -> using these technical and or soft skills)<br/>
                   - include buzz words for soft skills; important to compliment your tech skills (leadership, communication, collaboration, etc.)<br/>
                   - include <b>HOW</b> the skills in your skill set section developed with projects<br/>
                   - data/ metrics are a plus; try to include concrete numerical data where applicable<br/>
                   - include relevant project subsection in employment section if directly relevant<br/>
                   - any outside work, label as "relevant experience"<br/>
                   - .pdf is an ideal format when including your resume to a job application (use <a href="https://pdftotext.com/" target="_blank">ATS</a> to see if it parses all your resume's text)<br/>
                   - format hyperlinks to make it obvious they are links<br/>
                   - organize sections of your resume in a way that is easy to differentiate each of them<br/>
                   - be consistent in how you label/ indent sections and subsections of your resume based on its structure<br/>
                   - prioritize top to bottom the following order (objective -> skills -> education -> work -> relevant experience etc.)<br/><br/>

                   Here is the before and after of my current resume given my previous tips, and Melissa's tips respectively:<br/><br/>
                   <b>Before:</b><br/>
                   <object width="100%" height="1050px" data="IResume.pdf"></object><br/><br/>
                   <b>After:</b><br/>
                   <object width="100%" height="1050px" data="MyResume.pdf"></object><br/><br/>

                   <b>Changes</b><br/>
                   The most obvious one is that I found a way to move my skill set to the top with the use of columns. Also, listing them vertically
                   makes it easier for a recruiter to see what all my skills are versus listing them horizontally. For the margins, they are now 
                   expanded. Hyperlinks are now noticeable. For the content, I moved some of my projects to the experience section since they are
                   directly related to the organization. "Projects" is now labeled with "Relevant" to emphasize the urgency for a recruiter consider them. I also focused on adding more metrics
                   and communicating the impacts I made rather than the task I did in addition to my skill applications. The added content made
                   me have to limit spaces and font sizes. The expanded margins also helped make space. Lastly, I added a brief objective stating
                   the line of work I am looking for with what I have to offer.
