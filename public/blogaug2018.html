                	Here is the code for <a href="socket.tar.gz">Linux</a> and <a href="socket.zip">Windows</a> for this tutorial. Assuming you are using Linux, extract the compressed file with the command
                	<font style="font-family:'Courier New'">tar -xzvf socket.tar.gz</font>. In the resulting socket directory, you will
                	find source code for the server and client as well as a makefile to compile them. From the makefile, you have the option of the
                	following commands:<br/><br/>
                	<div class="codebox">   
                	   <font style="font-family:'Courier New'">
                		   <font color="lime">make</font> <font color="blue"># standard compile</font><br/>	
                		   <font color="lime">make debug</font> <font color="blue"># compile with debugging symbols</font><br/>
                		   <font color="lime">make clean</font> <font color="blue"># remove binary files</font><br/>
                	   </font>
                	</div><br/>
                	After compiling the code, run the server using the command <font style="font-family:'Courier New'">./server&</font>. The
                	'&' makes this run in the background. You can now run the client using the command
                	<font style="font-family:'Courier New'">./client insert message here</font>. If done correctly, the server should
                	print the message you specified via command line argument when running the client. The output should look like the
                	following:<br/><br/>
                	<center><img src="socketout.png" width="100%"/></center><br/><br/>
                	<b>Watch out for the following errors</b><br/>
                	1. If there is a bind failure, that means a server might still be running on the specified port and IP address. To 
                	verify this, use the <font style="font-family:'Courier New'">ps</font> command to show the currently running 
                	processes. To kill the server, use either <font style="font-family:'Courier New'">kill [pid#]</font> or
                	<font style="font-family:'Courier New'">pkill server</font>. Notice in the code you can also change the port. Both
                	the client and the server will need the same port number to connect to each other.<br/>
                	2. If there is a connect failure, the client failed to reach the server due to attempting to connect to the wrong
                	address or the server either terminated unexpected (possibly due to the first error) or it isn't running at all.
                	In the code provided, the IP addresses and port numbers of the server and client are the same so it is unlikely that
                	this error will be caused by the former.<br/>

                	Here are the steps to utilize Socket programming. The example code shown are snippets of a program where the
                	server listens for a client that contains a message to be printed to stdout. The code will be provided in part
                	3 of this blog post.<br/><br/>
                	<b>Server</b><br/>
                	1. You need descriptors for the server socket to listen and the client socket to receive from. In order to bind them,
                	you will need to create a <font style="font-family:'Courier New'">struct sockaddr</font> that will contain the IP
                	address and port number. The length of this struct will also be needed as an argument for some Socket functions. Lastly,
                	you need a buffer to store message contents to be sent or received.<br/>
                	<img src="server1.png" width="100%"/><br/><br/>
                	2. Simply create the socket.<br/>
                	<img src="server2.png" width="100%"/><br/><br/>
                	3. In order to bind the socket, you need to initialize the sockaddr struct to contain the protocol, IP address, and
                	port number. Bind the socket and be sure to use the <font style="font-family:'Courier New'">sizeof</font> operator
                	for the length of the struct.<br/>
                	<img src="server3.png" width="100%"/><br/><br/>
                	4. Now that the socket is binded, you can have it listen for incoming sockets.<br/>
                	<img src="server4.png" width="100%"/><br/><br/>
                	5. In order to achieve a connection between the server and the client, assign the client socket to accept given
                	the server socket.<br/>
                	<img src="server5.png" width="100%"/><br/><br/>
                	6. It is now possible to send or receive messages. For sending messages, use the message string length and for receiving,
                	use the buffer size.<br/>
                	<img src="server6.png" width="100%"/><br/><br/>
                	7. DO NOT forget to close your sockets when they are no longer in use. This will allow the used ports and IP addresses
                	to be available for new sockets.<br/>
                	<img src="server7.png" width="100%"/><br/><br/>
                	<b>Client</b><br/>
                	1. You will need a descriptor for the client socket to connect to the server. Using a 
                	<font style="font-family:'Courier New'">struct sockaddr</font> will store the needed IP address and port number needed
                	to achieve the connection. Lastly, you will need a buffer to store message contents to be sent or received.<br/>
                	<img src="client1.png" width="100%"/><br/><br/>
                	2. Simply create the socket.<br/>
                	<img src="client2.png" width="100%"/><br/><br/>
                	3. Similarly to bind, the sockaddr struct will need to be initialized in order for the client to connect to the server.<br/>
                	<img src="client3.png" width="100%"/><br/><br/>
                	4. At this point, you can send or receive messages.<br/>
                	<img src="client4.png" width="100%"/><br/><br/>
                	5. Once again, close the socket when finished.<br/>

                	<b>What are Sockets?</b><br/>
                	Sockets are abstractions that contain the necessary implementation to connect clients and servers over a networked
                	connection in order to provide communication between systems. In a Socket implemented application, a server contains the 
                	socket to listen for client bound sockets reaching out on a specified IP address and port in order to form a
                	connection. Sockets are very widely used in networked systems and applications. Examples of programs that utilize 
                	sockets are instant messaging apps and cloud storage. In this blog post, I will be discussing the basic universal 
                	semantics in C to form a Socket based communication. Familiarize yourself with the Socket state diagram below that shows
                	the basic control flow:<br/><br/>
                	<center>                    
                	   <img src="socketstate.png" width="80%"/><br/><br/>
                	</center>
                	For this tutorial, we will be using the following methods from the <a href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/7908799/xns/syssocket.h.html" target="_blank">Socket API</a>:
                	<br/>
                	<font style="font-family:'Courier New'">
                		int socket(int domain, int type, int protocol)
                	</font><br/>
                	An unsigned int value is returned based on the numerical quantity of the socket created. Any socket returning a
                	negative value determines a failed attempt in creating the socket.<br/>
                	<b>domain:</b> protocol to use determined by Socket constant<br/>
                	<b>type:</b> how to communicate with protocol determined by Socket constant<br/>
                	<b>protocol:</b> protocol value (0 for IP)<br/>
                	<br/>
                	<font style="font-family:'Courier New'">
                		int bind(int socket, const struct sockaddr * address, socklen_t address_length)
                	</font><br/>
                	An unsigned int value is returned upon successful attachment of the socket to the given address and port. A negative
                	value determines a failure to connect to the given address and port.<br/>
                	<b>socket:</b> integer value corresponding to a given socket to bind<br/>
                	<b>address:</b> struct containing network routing information including IP address and port number<br/>
                	<b>address_length:</b> length of the struct in bytes<br/>
                	<br/>
                	<font style="font-family:'Courier New'">
                		int listen(int socket, int back_log)
                	</font><br/>
                	The server waits to receive a connection from a client. If this value is negative, the server cannot receive any
                	communication.<br/>
                	<b>socket:</b> integer value corresponding to given socket to receive inbound communication<br/>
                	<b>back_log:</b> maximum length in bytes for queue of pending communication<br/>
                	<br/>
                	<font style="font-family:'Courier New'">
                		int accept(int socket, struct sockaddr * address, socklen_t address_length)
                	</font><br/>

                	their return values determine failure. Also, you will typically need a buffer to make use of sockets.
                	This is the container that gets sent through the socket that enables communication.<br/><br/>

                	I have noticed a a subculture among software engineers that presents a fondness for professional networking. This is what inspired
                	the creation of <a href="http://crosscodes.biz" target="_blank">Crosscodes</a> in my case; to showcase my professional work and experience while job hunting, and to document what I have learned in my career on this blog. This experience typically begins in university where students are adamant in obtaining a quantity of technical skills from their classes whilst performing at the highest caliber possible. A software engineer with an ideal attitude is described as "one who is always hungry to learn". The goal is to be professionally competitive in terms of experience in order to gain access to higher standing careers. Through academics, this can be achieved through GPA, awards, recognition, projects, letters of recommendation, degrees, and technical knowledge. Outside of academics, one can also seek more experience through engineering organizations, outside projects, hackathons, internships, and relevant employment. The presence of this experience follows with the steps to land an engineering title under a respectable company and acquire even more technical skills. A good place to start in one's job hunting journey are career fairs where multiple companies are arranged in panels where participants can showcase their resumes and electronic portfolios or relevant work. Hackathons also typically have company panels where showcasing one's resume is also appropriate in addition to submitting a winning hack. Companies present at hackathons typically assess participants' performance based on their hack. This makes hackathons a perfect place to showcase one's technical ability since companies use these events to look for potential candidates. While software engineers taking part in this networking culture are selling their competencies, companies are looking for engineers to invest in since they can provide valuable assets. Thus, companies are also competing to hire and compensate engineers to the best of their ability. I have also seen job fairs and professional networking events happening within engineering organizations. One's resume is their best friend when marketing their skills. It is also appropriate in casual settings to showcase one's resume therefore, always having one at hand is good practice. There have been multiple times where I have been asked for my resume in casual settings when I gave off hints of being a software engineer in search of a job; to where I reply by presenting the link to this website. These casual settings can happen anywhere including company social gatherings where the purpose is for engineers to get to know each other in terms of who posses what skill set, and bond to form a team. One looking to move up the ranks within their company can take advantage of this setting by chatting with higher experienced individuals. Individuals who have taken an extra step in this networking culture have created websites to not only showcase their experience, but present it in a personal way thereby proving technical competencies in web development in particular but more importantly, validating presentation skills and showing a uniqueness in personality. Having a <a href="http://linkedin.com" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> and/ or <a href="http://github.com" target="_blank">GitHub</a> account are also great ways for one to present their experience and have an online persona. This contributes
                	to a world wide web of software engineers available to connect and compete for networking power in order to gain the upper advantage.
                	I have also noticed individuals blogging or publishing specific work or articles while connecting with other software engineers either for mentoring, or
                	to expand their networking power. Keep in mind that soft skills should not be ignored. In fact, a common mistake for some individuals is spending too much time harnasing
                	their technical skills while neglecting their soft skills. To stand out even further, one will want to have good communication skills and be presentable. This involves
                	but is not limited to being able to communicate effectively in a panel, showcasing slide shows, being organized, punctual, and being a leader and a team player. Although this
                	blog post was focused on the technical aspect of the networking culture, that is only one out of many aspects to consider when being professionally competitive.

                	Whether it's a job application, phone screen, or interview, chances are you will be asked to put a
                	quantitative mark on your salary expectations. When searching for a job, this can feel uneasy for
                	an applicant because they would not want to over estimate and appear too expensive or arrogant to
                	be given a job offer. The same applies on the opposite side of the spectrum where no one would
                	want to low-ball themselves and be stuck with limited job offers. From research, experience, and
                	mentoring from individuals who have experience in the industry, I present some tips on how to
                	address the salary question given certain scenarios.<br/><br/>
                	<b>Do your research</b><br/>
                	First of all, it is important to understand that salary is only one out of multiple compensations that a
                	company has to offer. One mustn't forget about health benefits, 401k, paid vacation, personal time,
                	work hour options, ability to work remotely, company culture, location, etc. All of these factors should be
                	weighted in when deciding to apply for a company based on its perks. There is no utopian company so
                	compensate accordingly. Some good links to start research on company perks are:<br/>
                	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://glassdoor.com/salary" target="_blank">Glassdoor</a><br/>
                	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://indeed.com/salary" target="_blank">Indeed</a><br/>
                	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://paysa.com/" target="_blank">Paysa</a><br/><br/>
                	If you are going to negotiate your salary, have an idea of what you are worth based on the
                	skill set you have to offer. As of writing this blog post, the average starting salary for
                	software engineers in San Diego is $78,501 according to <a href="https://www.google.com/search?ei=B22QW7a3HMma_QaLoojgDw&q=san+diego+average+software+engineer+starting+salary&oq=san+diego+average+software+engineer+starting+salary&gs_l=psy-ab.3...14574.18693..18853...0.0..0.181.1546.0j11......0....1..gws-wiz.......0i71j0i8i30.clnoYqaBgoA" target="_blank">Google</a>. 
                	Location is also a determining factor of salary. If you must provide a specific answer for your salary expectations,
                	use a range based on substantial research. Also be sure
                	you are comfortable with the lower end of the range of what you ask for. Of course, it is preferable to defer
                	an answer for your salary which I will explain below.<br/><br/>
                	<b>Job Application</b><br/>
                	Usually, job applications that ask for your expected salary provide a list of salary ranges. Once again,
                	do your research and be sure you are okay with being paid in the low end of that range. If it's an
                	open-ended input, then you can defer your answer by tying "negotiable", "applicable", "open", etc. I
                	normally put "up for in-person discussion". This prevents you from being eliminated for being too
                	expensive or from limiting yourself to accepting a lower pay just to be hired.<br/><br/>
                	<b>Phone screening</b><br/>
                	You may be asked about your salary expectations during a phone screen. Be careful as going too high may
                	eliminate you from being considered. Going too low is also not the ideal way to approach it. Depending on the employer,
                	they may be checking to see whether you value your work. A good approach is to go on the offensive within
                	reason. It is okay to reply; "On average, how much is offered for this position?" Telling the recruiter that
                	you did research can be risky. Data you find may not be up-to-date or you might appear to be bargaining the
                	company giving the impression that you might be difficult to work with. Also consider taking a more 
                	defensive approach. "I would like to discuss this later in the application process in the event that I am hired.
                	I trust that what you have to offer your candidates are competitive based on the impression I have of this
                	company." If all fails and a number must be given, refer to your research and more importantly, be humble but confident. In
                	this case, it may be ideal to take the offensive approach.<br/><br/>
                	<b>Interview</b><br/>
                	Unless you have been given the offer up front, take the same approach I mentioned in the phone screening section
                	of the application process. Once you do get the offer, this is the ideal time to actively negotiate your
                	salary. Know your value and do your research to ensure that you and the company get the most out of the
                	negotiation. Also, if you are this far in the application process, do not be afraid to go slightly above the
                	market. At the very least, you might be paid above your baseline. This also lets the interviewer know that you
                	value your work and are willing to do the job in a worthwhile manner for you are an investment to the company.<br/><br/>
                	To conclude, it is important to be humble in the process of answering the salary question. Do your research on
                	the company, job position, and location and base your answer from that. If possible, defer your answer until
                	you are given the offer. Once you made it that far, it is then preferable to be confident in negotiating a specific
                	mark. Also, never be timid about salary question. Part of it is an assessment of your confidence and self-worth.

                	There have been multiple times where I have experienced Linux booting into the temporary root file system "initramfs". After
                	doing some research, this seems to happen due to a bad superblock typically resulting from an unexpected shutdown. This was
                	very prominent in Linux Mint 18.3 Sylvia when my laptop battery would die. In this blog post, I present a remedy for bad
